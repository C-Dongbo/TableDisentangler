The response rate by intention to treat was 31&#x00025; (17 of 55, three complete response, 14 partial response; 95&#x00025; CI = 19&#x02013;45&#x00025;) and in evaluable patients (completed one cycle, <italic>n</italic> = 42), it was 40&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI = 26&#x02013;57&#x00025;). In addition, 24&#x00025; (13 of 55) patients achieved disease stabilization. The overall median survival was 11 months with a 1-year survival of 45&#x00025;. The median survival for evaluable patients was 18 months with 1- and 2-year survivals of 60&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; respectively. The median survival of responding patients was 31 months and the three patients achieving complete response remain progression-free at 14+, 18+ and 23+ months. Evaluable patients with poor prognostic features achieved a response rate of 54&#x00025; and median survival of 18 months. Toxicity was significant yet manageable with 12 patients unable to complete one cycle due to side-effects and 36&#x00025; experiencing grade 3&#x02013;4 toxicities. The three on-treatment deaths were considered unlikely to be due to toxicity. The schedule of IFN-&#x003b1;, IL-2 and PVI 5FU has significant activity in advanced renal cell cancer with manageable toxicity. It is of particular interest that this regimen appears to have high activity in fit patients with poor prognostic features. &#x000a9; 2000 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>renal cell cancer</kwd><kwd>interleukin-2</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>5-fluorouracil</kwd><kwd>biochemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
