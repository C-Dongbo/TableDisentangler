Three (5%) patients had complete and 6 (11%) partial response, and 7 (13%) patients had stable disease at least for 3 months. The patients with an objective response (n = 9) survived longer than the rest of the patients if the length of survival was calculated from the start of chemotherapy (P = 0.0006). However, the responding patients also had longer time interval from the diagnosis to the detection of distant metastases (P = 0.05), and survival time from disease progression following DTIC and CCNU therapy (P = 0.005). These findings suggest that patients with an objective response to DTIC-CCNU therapy have melanoma with a slow progression rate, and prolonged survival in such patients may in part result from the less aggressive biological nature of their tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00209-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="154" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00209-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="155" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00209-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="156" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
