Sixty healthy, adult women were randomly assigned to receive copper [Cu(II)] at four concentrations in their drinking water following a Latin-square design. Each group (n = 15) received tap water with no added copper, 1, 3, and 5 mg Cu/l of added copper sulfate for a 2-week study period, followed by 1 week of standard tap water. The subjects recorded their water consumption and gastrointestinal symptoms daily on a special form. The average daily consumption of water was 1.64 liters per subject, regardless of the amount of copper added. Final serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and liver enzymes were measured in all subjects and were not different from baseline concentrations. Twenty-one subjects (35%) recorded gastrointestinal disturbances sometime during the study, 9 had diarrhea, some with abdominal pain and vomiting, and 12 subjects presented abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. There was no association between copper levels in drinking water and diarrhea. However, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting were significantly related to copper concentrations in water. The recorded incidence rate of these symptoms was 5, 2, 17, and 15% while ingesting water with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg Cu/l, respectively (overall [chi]2 = 11.3, p&#x0003c;0.01; Cu [less than/equal to]1 mg/l versus Cu [Greater than/equal to]3 mg/l, [chi]2, p&#x0003c;0.01). When subjects interrupted their consumption of drinking water with added copper, most symptoms disappeared. We conclude that under the conditions of the study, there was no association between aggregate copper in drinking water within the range of 0-5 mg/l and diarrhea, but a [Greater than/equal to]3 mg Cu/l level of ionized copper was associated with nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting. Additional studies with sufficient numbers of subjects are needed to define thresholds for specific gastrointestinal symptoms with precision and to extrapolate these results to the population at large.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0064-a" xlink:role="118"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0065-a" xlink:role="119"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="117" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="118" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="119" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="120" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00507-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="121" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
