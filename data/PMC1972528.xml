Effects of this therapy were assessed using serum marker concentration, Ki67 and gastrin-immunoreactivity of the primary tumour. In four out of 12 patients, a significant decrease in Ki67 immunoreactivity was seen during SMS 201.995 treatment while in the remaining eight patients there was no significant change in Ki67 expression. Four patients had elevated pretreatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In two of these four patients, serum CEA levels fell modestly during SMS 201.995 therapy. This is the first clinical evidence that a somatostatin analogue can inhibit the growth of some colorectal cancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00214-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="971" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00214-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="972" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00214-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="973" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00214-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="974" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
