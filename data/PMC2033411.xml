BIS-1 combines a specificity against CD3 on T lymphocytes with a specificity against a 40 kDa pancarcinoma-associated antigen, EGP-2. Patients received BIS-1 F(ab')2 fragments intravenously at doses of 1, 3 and 5 micrograms kg-1 body weight during a concomitantly given standard s.c. IL-2 treatment. For each dose, four patients were treated with a 2 h BIS-1 infusion in the second and fourth week of IL-2 therapy. Acute BIS-1 F(ab')2-related toxicity with symptoms of chills, peripheral vasoconstriction and temporary dyspnoea was observed in 2/4 and 5/5 patients at the 3 and 5 micrograms kg-1 dose level respectively. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIS-1 F(ab')2 was 5 micrograms kg-1. Elevated plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were detected at the MTD. Flow cytometric analysis showed a dose-dependent binding of BIS-1 F(ab')2 to circulating T lymphocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated after treatment with 3 and 5 micrograms kg-1 BIS-1, showed increased specific cytolytic capacity against EGP-2+ tumour cells as tested in an ex vivo performed assay. Maximal killing capacity of the PBMCs, as assessed by adding excess BIS-1 to the assay, was shown to be decreased after BIS-1 infusion at 5 micrograms kg-1 BIS-1 F(ab')2. A BIS-1 F(ab')2 dose-dependent disappearance of circulating mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood was observed. Within the circulating CD3+ CD8+ lymphocyte population. LFA-1 alpha-bright and HLA-DR+ T-cell numbers decreased preferentially. It is concluded that i.v. BIS-1 F(ab')2, when combined with s.c. IL-2, has a MTD of 5 micrograms kg-1. The treatment endows the T lymphocytes with a specific anti-EGP-2-directed cytotoxic potential.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="652" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="653" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="654" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="655" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="656" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="657" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="658" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="659" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="660" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="661" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
