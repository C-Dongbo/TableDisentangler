Paclitaxel was administered intravenously over 3 h at a dose of 225 mg m(-2) on a 21-day cycle for six courses. Thirty-six patients were entered into this study; all 36 were assessed for toxicity and 33 patients were evaluable for response. One patient had a complete response and 12 patients had partial responses (overall response rate 39.4%, 95% CI 23-58%). The overall median duration of response was 9 months (range 3.5-23+ months). The response rate to carboplatin following failure of paclitaxel within 1 year of stopping therapy was 57% (four out of seven patients). The median survival of patients was 17.2 months. The main toxicity encountered was neutropenia which was WHO grade 3 in 11 patients (31%) and WHO grade 4 in seven patients (19%). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) was not given to any patient during the study. Other toxicities were: grade 3/4 infection (11%) and nausea and vomiting (11%); grade 3 bone pain (22%), fatigue (14%), diarrhoea (3%), myalgia/arthralgia (3%) and dry eyes (3%). Transient peripheral neuropathy occurred in 16 patients (44%), and alopecia was encountered in most patients (grade 2/3, 78%). Paclitaxel given at 225 mg m(-2) to patients with stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer is active, well tolerated and does not require GCSF support.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00182-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="710" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00182-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="711" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00182-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="712" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00182-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="713" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00182-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="714" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
