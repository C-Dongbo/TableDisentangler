There were two partial responses lasting 40 and 105 weeks respectively. In addition five patients had disease stabilisation lasting 25, 35, 40, 66 and 70 weeks respectively and 23 patients had progressive disease. No significant or unexpected toxicities occurred. This minimally toxic therapy halted disease progression for 6 months or more in 23% of patients, the majority of whom were heavily pretreated. There were five early deaths due to disease progression. The use of goserelin in patients with epithelial ovarian cancers resistant to or relapsing soon after first line platinum based chemotherapy needs to be further evaluated.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00068-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="621" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00068-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="622" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00068-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="623" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
