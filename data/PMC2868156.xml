The dogs were separated into two groups: group I (GI) (n = 9) and group II (GII) (n = 9). Right and left pneumonectomies were performed on the animals in GI and GII, respectively. Each group was further divided into three subgroups according to BS closure technique: subgroup I (SGI) (n = 3), manual suture; subgroup II (SGII) (n = 3), stapler; and subgroup III (SGIII) (n = 3), manual suture plus tissue flab. The dogs were sacrificed after one month of observation, and the bronchial stumps were removed for histological examination. The complications observed during a one-month period following pneumonectomy in nine dogs (n = 9) were: BPF (n = 5), peri-operative cardiac arrest (n = 1), post-operative respiratory arrest (n = 1), post-operative cardiac failure (n = 1) and cardio-pulmonary failure (n = 1). Histological healing was classified as complete or incomplete healing. Histological healing and BPF complications in the subgroups were analyzed statistically. There was no significant difference in histological healing between SGI and SGIII (<italic>p</italic> = 1.00; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), nor between SGII and SGIII (<italic>p</italic> = 1.00; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between the subgroups in terms of BPF (<italic>p</italic> = 0.945; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The results of the statistical analysis indicated that manual suture, stapler or manual suture plus tissue flab could be alternative methods for BS closure following pneumonectomy in dogs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bronchial closure</kwd><kwd>bronchial stump</kwd><kwd>dog</kwd><kwd>pneumonectomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pneumonectomy is a lung resection technique that has been used to remove all lung lobes in humans and dogs when bilobectomy or lobectomy techniques are inadequate to remove the pathology in the hemi-thorax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In dogs, pneumonectomy has been performed in some pathological conditions, such as lung tumors, congenital lung anomalies, chronic lung collapse, chronic progressive lung inflammation, post-traumatic diffuse parenchymal laceration, and bronchial rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The reported morbidity and mortality rate after pneumonectomy is extremely high in humans suffering from respiratory, cardiac and gastrointestinal system problems, acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary thromboembolism, bronchopleural fistula (BPF), pyothorax, esophagopleural fistula, cardiac herniation, lung lobe torsion, hemathorax and chylothorax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The most commonly encountered complication of pneumonectomy in humans is BPF, which is described as a pathologic connection between the bronchus and pleural space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Closure failure of the bronchial stump (BS) after partial or complete lung resection is the primary cause of BPF in humans, leading to a prolonged hospitalization period and the need for multiple operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have reported of the incidence of BPF to be in the range of 0-28%, while others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] have reported the incidence to be between 0% and 12%. The mortality rate of BPF has been reported to be between 15% and 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Pneumonia, pleural infections and failure in BS closure are the primary risk factors for BPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The proper BS closure technique to prevent BS dehiscence after pneumonectomy has been long debated in the field of human thoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, the stapler technique has been used to prevent BPF in humans and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. There seems to be no consensus between researchers regarding the optimal method for BS closure because several authors have made different suggestions for this procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The surgical procedures for BS closure are focused on suture line (transversal versus longitudinal), suture technique (manual versus mechanical), clamping technique (open stump technique versus closed stump technique) and whether or not to wrap the BS (e.g. pleuralization, flap) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Both manual (by running or interrupted suture) and mechanical sutures have been routinely used in humans and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The superiority of both methods has been clearly demonstrated by incidence of BPF complications in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In recent years, the autogenic tissue wrapping of the BS after pneumonectomy has been reported to decrease the incidence of BPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, in this technique the intercostal muscle flaps are primarily used to support the vascularity of the BS and the line of anastomosis in the trachea. In addition, the popularity of intercostal muscle flap usage has been increased in human thoracic surgery due to their thickness, autogenous and self-vascularization properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, this literature data was compared with the histologic healing and BPF complications encountered following three different BS closure techniques (manual suture, stapler and manual suture plus tissue flab) after pneumonectomy in dogs were evaluated for a period of one month.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental group</title><p>A total of 27 hybrid dogs (two years old, 20 kg in weight and sex was not considered) were used in this study. Histological healing was evaluated in 18 dogs (n = 18); nine dogs (n = 9) were reviewed separately due to postoperative complications. The 18 dogs were separated into two groups: group I (GI) (n = 9) and group II (GII) (n = 9). Right and left pneumonectomies were performed in the dogs in GI and GII, respectively. The dogs in GI and GII were further divided into three subgroups [subgroup I (SGI) (n = 3), subgroup II (SGII) (n = 3) and subgroup III (SGIII) (n = 3)] according to the BS closure technique performed. The main stem bronchus was closed with a manual suture in subgroup I (SGI) (n = 3), with a stapler in subgroup II (SGII) (n = 3), and with a manual suture plus tissue flab (pedicled intercostal externus-internus muscle) in subgroup III (SGIII) (n = 3) following pneumonectomy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The dogs were anesthetized and continued with 2% isofloran after the administration of xylasine HCl (1 mg/kg IM) and thiopental Na (15 mg/kg IV).

Thoracotomy incision was made on the 4th intercostal space according to the standard procedure in the SGI and SGII groups, but the 4th intercostal externus - internus muscle prepared as a pedicled flap in the SGIII group. The main stem bronchus was dissected after ligation of the pulmonary arteries and veins. Pneumonectomy was carried out using the open bronchi resection technique in groups SGI and SGIII.

Extra vertical mattress suture(s) was/were applied over the excision side of the BS in cases where air bubbles occurred due to the BS. Saline was aspirated, and a 28-French thoracostomy tube (Argyle, USA) was inserted into the pleural cavity ventro-cranially. The tube was fixed to the skin with a 'Chinese finger trap' suture pattern, and a Heimlich flutter valve was connected to the tube for pleural drainage.</p><p>Postoperative care was carried out in compliance with the rules of the National Society of Medical Research Principles of Laboratory Animal Care for a period of one month. The dogs were relieved with carprofen (5 mg/kg/d SC). Cefazolin Na (20 mg/kg IV tid) was used as an antibiotic agent for 5 days. Lactate ringer and hetastarch solutions were infused for postoperative fluid therapy. Hematologic parameters and blood gas analysis of the dogs were controlled routinely, and the dogs were closely monitored for suspected cardiac problems and respiratory failure after pneumonectomy. The dogs were checked radiologically in cases of suspected respiratory insufficiency. The thoracostomy tube and skin sutures were removed on days 5 and 7 after surgery, respectively. At the end of the postoperative first month, the dogs in GI and GII were sacrificed with high-dose thiopental Na. The BS was removed from each animal, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Five micrometer thick sections from these samples were placed on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination.</p><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's chi-square test to determine the differences between subgroups in terms of histological healing and BPF complications, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bronchial closure</title><p>Postoperative ventrodorsal and lateral radiographs showed no signs of intra-thoracic pathology, such as pneumothorax or hemathorax, in the dogs during a one-month period following pneumonectomy.

Respiratory arrest and sudden onset of death were typically seen in the dogs with BPF. Tension pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema were observed in the postmortem radiographs of these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Necropsy of the dogs supported these findings and revealed bronchial dehiscence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and atelectatic lung lobes.</p><p>In SGI, necropsy on the dog that died on the 15th day revealed myocardial petechial hemorrhagic spots related to the cardiac failure. In a different dog in SGI, the cause of the postoperative respiratory arrest (1 h after surgery) was insufficient lung volume, which caused the postoperative SPO<sub>2</sub> value of the dog to decrease. In SGIII, alveolar emphysema, pneumonia and petechial myocardial hemorrhage were seen macroscopically in the dog with cardiopulmonary failure that died during the 3rd week after surgery. Peri-operative cardiac arrest after left pneumonectomy was seen as a complication in one of the dogs in SGIII. This was related to an underlying cardiac problem, which was determined to be an atrioventricular blockage and sinus pause after pneumonectomy based on the results of ECG.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological findings</title><p>Subgroup I (manual suture): Histological examinations revealed complete healing in 4 out of 6 bronchial stumps. Granulation tissue formation with new vessel formations as well as continued phagocytosis of the suture material was seen around these 4 bronchial stumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

The prevention and treatment of these complications are important topics in thoracic surgery. A considerable number of retrospective studies have been performed on bronchial closure techniques in human medicine, and a few experimental studies have been carried out on the basis of these retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, BS closure techniques, their histological healing patterns and possible cardiac, respiratory and gastrointestinal system complications after pneumonectomy have not been compared experimentally and have only been reviewed in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Several techniques have been described for BS closure in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Of these techniques, manual suture has been shown to be a safe and cost-effective technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The superiority of stapler suture to manual suture remains questionable, and several recent studies have compared the stapler with manual suture techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study, manual and stapler suture techniques were used in the SGI and SGII groups, respectively. Manual suture, stapler and BS covering with flaps after manual suture closure are still in use today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Pleural flaps, patch with pedicle, pericardial grafts, pericardial fat pad grafts, diaphragm, azygous vein, pericardiophrenic pedicles, mediastinum and transposition of extra-thoracic muscles (intercostal, serratus and latissimus dorsi) have been used as flaps in human thoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Intercostal muscle flaps are superior to other flaps due to their flexibility, thickness, vascularity and autogenous features, and the usage of these flaps has been recommended by a number of thoracic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, in this study, pedicled intercostal externus-internus muscle was used to buttress the manual suture line of the BS closure in the SGIII group.</p><p>There are many alternative suture techniques used for BS closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Hollaus et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] advised the use of simple interrupted and over-to-over suture patterns for BS closure in humans. In veterinary literature, interrupted horizontal and continuous suture patterns have been used for BS closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this study, hermetically horizontal mattress sutures were performed over the excision site, without affecting the vascularity of the main stem bronchus, and the end of the BS was manually sutured with a simple interrupted suture pattern in SGI. In humans and dogs, TA-55 and TA-30 staplers have been reported during pneumonectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] by the parallel approximation of the mucosal membranous and cartilaginous portions of the bronchus and applying the staple transversally to the bronchus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>If the BS is to be closed with a suture, it is important that the same surgical team perform the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study, all BS closures were carried out by the same surgical team.</p><p>Current literatures indicate that the application of 20-40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O intra-bronchial pressure is sufficient to determine the amount of bronchial air leakage before thoracic closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Similarly, the intra-bronchial pressure increases by up to 200 mmHg in humans at the time of coughing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Considering these findings and the possible postoperative coughing and barking of the dogs, 50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure was applied intra-bronchially to test for air leakage. In cases of air bubbles occurring from the BS, extra vertical mattress suture(s) was/were applied over the excision side of the BS.</p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in clean-contaminated pulmonary surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Pulmonary resection is associated with a considerable risk of infection; therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis has become a routine procedure during and after pulmonary operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Triple dose of antibiotic applications are advised in pulmonary surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, only one dose of prophylactic cephalosporin has been suggested to be an effective dosage following pneumonectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this study, cefazolin Na was administered during the postoperative period, and no infection-related complications were encountered.</p><p>Mediastinal shift is seen as a consequence of pleural cavity diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This condition also results from pneumonectomy and causes esophageal and tracheal deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Radiologically, the shifted mediastinum was observed in all dogs, and no complications from the mediastinal shift were seen for one month after the operation.</p><p>In humans, a history of fever and sudden onset of continuous coughing after lung resection raises the suspicion of BPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study, in contrast to the results in humans, the clinical findings in the dogs with BPF were respiratory arrest and sudden onset of death. Tension pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema were seen in the postmortem radiographs, and necropsy of the dogs revealed the occurrence of bronchial dehiscence and confirmed the BPF.</p><p>Possible cardiac, respiratory and gastrointestinal system complications after pneumonectomy have been reported in humans and dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study, five BPFs, one cardiac failure, one postoperative respiratory arrest, one cardio-pulmonary failure and one peri-operative cardiac arrest were seen in the dogs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Necropsy findings, postoperative SPO<sub>2</sub> values and ECG findings revealed these complications in this study. It is our opinion that further studies can be planned to demonstrate the complications after pneumonectomy in dogs.</p><p>BPF is frequently encountered within the first three weeks after pneumonectomy in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Pneumonectomy is considered to be an operative technique failure of BS closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, the fifth postoperative day is the most critical day for bronchial dehiscence, and the incidence of early BPF in the suture technique is 8.6%, although its incidence is 1% in the stapler technique. The incidence of BPF following manual suture plus autogenic tissue coverage is 3.9% in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The main focus of this study was not to determine the incidence of BPF in dogs, but we do report that we encountered five BPF complications in 27 dogs. All BPF complications were encountered within the first three weeks and resulted in death. There were no statistically significant differences between the techniques regarding BPF complication.</p><p>Information on the inflammatory reactions between the suture material and bronchi are important to the prevention of postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, neutrophil reactions with different intensities were seen after manual suture closure. In the present study, the stapler closure of the bronchi proved to be the preferred alternative within the three closure techniques used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, it is unclear which technique is superior to the others from a histological healing point of view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is important to note that avascular necrosis and inflammation of the BS after stapler closure have not been well explained in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, the stapler technique was better than the other techniques and resulted in less severe inflammation and a faster healing process. Hemorrhage was the only complication of the stapler technique. Current literatures indicate that vascular tissue with pedicle is required for the early healing of the BS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, pedicle flaps warranted the BS healing in the critical revascularization period continuing for 3-4 weeks, and decreased the risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Self-vascularized flaps are reported to enhance the healing of the BS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. According to Algar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], intercostal flaps have shown excellent histological results. Although Yamamoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] indicated that intercostal flaps prevented BPF complications, Demos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that these flaps could cause fibrosis, ossification and calcification. In our study, a severe inflammatory reaction was observed against the degeneration and necrosis of the flap and suture material. The inflammatory reaction caused a delay in the healing process. There were no statistically significant differences in histological healing among the subgroups. In the present study, we emphasize that the use of a thinner muscle flap can potentially reduce the inflammatory reaction, thus resulting in faster healing.</p><p>In conclusion, manual suture closure of the BS is still a current conventional technique. The usage of a stapler for BS closure is the best choice according to our histological data, although it cannot be considered to be a very economic technique. Manual suture plus intercostal externus- internus muscle flap technique has advantage for buttressing to BS. There were no statistically significant differences among the subgroups with regard to BPF complications. According to the histological healing results, the manual suture technique did not have an apparent advantage over the other techniques, but stapler closure seemed to be more acceptable than the other methods of closure. The use of manual suture plus tissue flap technique could not be recommended due to the observation of intense inflammatory reactions following this procedure. Statistical data indicated that none of the techniques seemed to have any superiority over the others with regard to histological healing. Taking the results of the statistical analysis into consideration, all three techniques (suture, stapler and suture plus tissue flab) can be used for BS closure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
