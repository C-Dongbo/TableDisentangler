Recently, the maximum tolerated dose of this drug has been revised upwards with reported increased response rates in several malignancies. We initiated a phase II study of high-dose EPI as initial treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (stage III and IV). Between May 1988 and November 1989, 25 patients were entered. The starting dose of EPI was 135 mg m-2, with dose attenuations and escalations of 15 mg m-2 based on mid-cycle evaluation of toxicity. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. Nine partial responses (36%, 95% CI: 18-57.5%) and 11 patients with disease stabilisation (44%) were observed. Median (range) time to progression was 19 (3-70) weeks. Median (range) survival is 32 (9-116+) weeks. There were no treatment related deaths. Major side effects were leukocytopenia WHO grade III/IV (23% of courses) and mucositis WHO grade II/III (15% of courses). In two patients left ventricular ejection fraction decreased greater than 15% compared to baseline values after a cumulative Epirubicin dose of 435 mg m-2, and therefore went off study. In none of the patients clinical signs of congestive heart failure were observed. We conclude from our data that high-dose EPI, contrary to previous negative studies using lower doses of EPI, ranks amongst the most active regimens against advanced NSCLC. Toxicity of high-dose EPI is moderate. Further evaluation of this compound in combination regimens is recommended.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00067-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="405" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00067-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="406" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00067-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="407" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00067-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="408" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
