Respondents had undergone allogeneic (46%) or autologous BMT (54%) for a haematological malignancy and were disease free and at least 12 months post BMT (mean 43 months). Variability in post-BMT QOL was reported with deficits in physical, sexual and occupational functioning particularly likely. Allogeneic recipients reported poorer QOL than autologous recipients. Greater age at BMT, lower level of education and more advanced disease at BMT were consistent risk factors for poorer QOL. Contrary to previous research, evidence for improved functional status with the passage of time post BMT was obtained. Factors generally not associated with post-BMT QOL included disease diagnosis, dose of total body irradiation, presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), type of GVHD prophylaxis and extent of marrow graft match. In conclusion, while many BMT recipients reported normal QOL, the majority indicated that their QOL was compromised relative to premorbid status. Prospective, longitudinal research will be necessary to further identify risk factors for poor post-BMT QOL and identify the temporal trajectory of post-BMT QOL.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1322" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1323" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1324" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1325" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1326" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1327" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1328" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1329" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
