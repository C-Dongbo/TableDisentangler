The aim of the present study was to determine if a combination of EPA with a conventional oral nutritional supplement could produce weight gain in these patients. Twenty patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were asked to consume two cans of a fish oil-enriched nutritional supplement per day in addition to their normal food intake. Each can contained 310 kcal, 16.1 g protein and 1.09 g EPA. Patients were assessed for weight, body composition, dietary intake, resting energy expenditure (REE) and performance status. Patients consumed a median of 1.9 cans day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. All patients were losing weight at baseline at a median rate of 2.9 kg month<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. After administration of the fish oil-enriched supplement, patients had significant weight-gain at both 3 (median 1 kg, <italic>P</italic> = 0.024) and 7 weeks (median 2 kg, <italic>P</italic> = 0.033). Dietary intake increased significantly by almost 400 kcal day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). REE per kg body weight and per kg lean body mass fell significantly. Performance status and appetite were significantly improved at 3 weeks. In contrast to previous studies of oral conventional nutritional supplements in weight-losing cancer patients, this study suggests that an EPA-enriched supplement may reverse cachexia in advanced pancreatic cancer. &#x000a9; 1999 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>cachexia</kwd><kwd>eicosapentaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>docosahexaenoic acid</kwd><kwd>fish oil</kwd><kwd>nutritional supplementation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
