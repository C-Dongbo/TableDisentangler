The data were complete up to 1 January 1980, with a median follow-up time of 36 months. The 3 major determinants of prognosis were the blood urea concentration (BUC), the haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), and the clinical performance status. Three prognostic groups based on these determinants were specified. The groups contained 22%, 56% and 22% of the patients and gave 2-year survival probabilities of 76%, 50% and 9% respectively. Patients in the good-prognosis group had a BUC less than or equal to 8 mM. [Hb] greater than or equal to 100 g/l, and no or minimal symptoms. Those in the poor-prognosis group had either [Hb] less than or equal to 75 g/l or a BUC greater than 10 mM and restricted clinical activity. Patients who had combinations of the 3 determinant features which excluded them from these 2 groups were classified into an intermediate prognosis group.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="831" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="832" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="833" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="834" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="835" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="836" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="837" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="838" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="839" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00459-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="840" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
