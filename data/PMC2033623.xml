However, the regimens used in these studies produce low response rates in patients with advanced disease. ECF is a new regimen which results in higher response rates and may therefore be more effective in the adjuvant setting. Twenty-nine patients who had undergone a potentially curative resection for oesphagogastric carcinoma were treated with ECF [epirubicin 50 mg m-2 and cisplatin 60 mg m-2 for 18 weeks]. The median age was 52.5 years. Three patients had oesophageal tumours, 14 had tumours of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) and 12 had gastric tumours. All were adenocarcinomas apart from one undifferentiated carcinoma. One patient had stage I disease, nine stage II, 17 stage II and two stage IV. The mean number of chemotherapy cycles per patient was 5.2 (range 2-8). The median follow-up was 8.4 months (1.5-36.3 months). Eleven patients relapsed during follow-up (38%). One patient had an anastomotic recurrence and ten patients distant metastases. Overall 3 year survival was 61.5% (95% confidence interval 42-79); 3 year survival in stage II was 50% (21.2-86.3) and in stage III 65.6% (40-86). Chemotherapy was well tolerated, with grade 3/4 toxicity as follows: leucopenia 13.5%, nausea and vomiting 10%, diarrhoea 3.5%, infection 3.5% and thrombocytopenia 3.5%. There were no treatment-related deaths. We conclude that ECF can be administered safely as adjuvant treatment to patients with surgically resected gastro-oesophageal carcinoma. The results, especially in patients with stage III disease, are encouraging and support the investigation of this regimen within a prospective randomised trial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="583" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="584" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="585" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="586" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
