Data of four previously untreated patients showed that cyclosporin-A can increase intracellular net-uptake of daunorubicin. A phase II study was initiated in 24 colorectal cancer patients. They received cyclosporin-A at a dose of 3 mg kg-1 over 1 h as i.v. infusion, at 7 h and at 1 h preceding cytotoxic drug administration. At the end of the second cyclosporin-A administration epidoxorubicin 90 mg m-2 was administered as i.v. bolus. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Median cyclosporin-A peak blood levels and levels at 18 h after cytotoxic drug administration appeared to be 6248 ng ml-1 and 1012 ng ml-1 respectively. Only one partial response was observed, despite these high cyclosporin-A levels. Cyclosporin-A did not cause major toxicity, only a 29% incidence of hot flushes was observed. Epidoxorubicin toxicities were as expected but the frequency of severe leucocytopenia was striking. This treatment schedule can not be considered active in colorectal cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="361" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="362" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="363" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="364" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
