Following withdrawal of certain growth factors, preclinical data suggest that there is a transient fall in the percentage of progenitor cells in cycle below the baseline, thus providing a window to administer chemotherapy with reduced risk of myelotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed, previously untreated neoplasia, were treated with pIXY321 by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 375 microg/m2 twice daily (total dose 750 microg/m2/day) for seven days (days -8 to -2), followed by a two-day rest (days -1 to 0). Patients received ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) on days 1 to 3. On day 4, pIXY321 was resumed until hematologic recovery. Peripheral blood was collected on days -8, -2, -1, 1, and cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated in this study and received a total of 54 cycles. Partial responses were observed in three of 13 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (23 percent) and two of five patients with small cell lung cancer (40 percent). Six of 15 patients had an increased number of cells in S+G2/M on day 1 of ICE following seven days of pIXY321 and two days off (days -1 to 0). The average increase was 63 percent (range 6-253). Seven patients had a decreased number of cells in S+G2/M. The average decrease was 55 percent (range 6.3-78). There were no significant differences among the fifteen patients with regards to the observed toxicity of the chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: pIXY321 in this schedule did not consistently decrease the percentage of cycling progenitor cells in the peripheral blood. Future studies should define whether other growth factors and/or schedules can synchronize progenitor cell cycling and protect the marrow compartment from cycle specific chemotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0005.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="355" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0006.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="356" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="357" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="358" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="359" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="360" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="361" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="362" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="363" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="364" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="365" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
