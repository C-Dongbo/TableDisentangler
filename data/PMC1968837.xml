Only four patients completed the course of six cycles of cisplatin 75 mg m-2 and cyclophosphamide 750 mg m-2 with rH GM-CSF, 3-5 micrograms kg-1 day-1, days 3-14, but one of these suffered a toxic death on study. Another died of disease progression. There were two episodes of life-threatening infection (WHO grade 4), and three patients were withdrawn because of various rH GM-CSF-related problems. Although potentially affording some patients the hypothetical benefits of dose intensification, as well as the possible attraction of a shorter duration of chemotherapy, this regimen is not without problems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="537" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="538" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="539" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="540" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
