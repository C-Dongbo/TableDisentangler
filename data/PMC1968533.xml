However there is significant renal tubular uptake of the radiolabelled peptide, which can obscure upper abdominal tumours and would preclude its use for targeted radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether amino acid infusion, which has been shown to block renal tubular peptide reabsorption, diminishes renal parenchymal uptake of this radiolabelled analogue. Eight patients being scanned with the 111In-labelled somatostatin analogue, pentetreotide, for localisation of gastroenteropancreatic tumours received an infusion of synthetic amino acids. The ratio of isotope uptake in kidney to that in spleen was assessed, and compared to the ratio for matched control patients, to determine if amino acid infusion reduced renal parenchymal uptake of the radiopharmaceutical. The amount of isotope in the urine was determined to ensure that any effect of the amino acid infusion was unrelated to changes in clearance. Infusion of amino acids significantly reduced renal parenchymal uptake of isotope at 4 h. There was a non-significant increase in urinary clearance of isotope over the 4 h, consistent with reduced reuptake and a lack of effect on glomerular filtration rate. This technique, by preventing renal damage, may allow the use of this somatostatin analogue for local radiotherapy, and could be of wider value in blocking tubular re-uptake of potentially nephrotoxic agents, such as radiolabelled Fab fragments.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0278-a" xlink:role="1438"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1437" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1438" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1439" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
