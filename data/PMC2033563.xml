All patients had normal serum tumour markers but persistent radiographic masses. The larger mass was routinely resected first. Fifteen patients (39%) had dissimilar histological findings at sequential surgical procedures, 12 of whom demonstrated less favourable pathological features during the first operation and three at the second. Patients who underwent both retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) and lung resection showed less favourable histological features in the retroperitoneum in nine cases and in the lung in three cases. Eight of 16 patients (50%) without mature teratoma in their primary tumours showed complete necrosis/fibrosis at all surgical interventions, whereas all patients whose primary tumour was classified as malignant teratoma intermediate demonstrated mature teratoma at least at one anatomical site. As histology of post-chemotherapy residual masses cannot be extrapolated from one anatomical site to another, patients usually are properly managed by excision of all residual masses. In particular, in patients with necrosis/fibrosis at lung resection omission of RPLND is not advised.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="960" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="961" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="962" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="963" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="964" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="965" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
