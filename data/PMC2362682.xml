Gemcitabine 1000 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> was given on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks, while vindesine 3 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> was administered weekly for 7 weeks, then every 2 weeks. A total of 42 patients with nonresectable NSCLC were included. The median age of patients was 56 years; 57&#x00025; were men, 52&#x00025; had adenocarcinoma, 31&#x00025; squamous cell carcinoma and 17&#x00025; had large-cell carcinoma. The performance status ranged from 0 to 2 with 83&#x00025; in performance status 1. The majority (55&#x00025;) had stage IV disease, while 40&#x00025; had stage III B and 5&#x00025; stage III A disease. WHO grade 3&#x02013;4 leucopenia occurred in five patients (12&#x00025;) and 9&#x00025; had grade 4 neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia grade 3&#x02013;4 was observed in six patients (15&#x00025;). There were no septic death or bleeding episodes. One patient had a transient WHO grade 4 increase in bilirubin, and four patients had a decrease in glomerular filtration rate below the normal limit; one of these patients developed a non-reversible renal insufficiency. Ten patients (24&#x00025;) complained of dyspnoea of uncertain mechanism, possibly involving bronchoconstriction. There were one complete and seven partial responses among 40 assessable patients (20&#x00025;, 95&#x00025; confidence limits 9&#x02013;36&#x00025;). Median response duration was 31 weeks (range 11&#x02013;83 weeks) and median survival time 31 weeks (range 2&#x02013;171 weeks). The current combination of gemcitabine and vindesine does not appear to be promising for further examination because of the toxicity and somewhat disappointing activity. &#x000a9; 1999 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>non-small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine, vindesine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
