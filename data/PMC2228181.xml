The present prospective trial of combined surgery and chemotherapy for the treatment of PGL (stage II) included 25 consecutive patients treated between July 1978 and December 1993. Twenty-one patients were treated with total gastrectomy and four with partial gastrectomy; this was followed by post-operative chemotherapy with m-VEPA (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone and doxorubicin), followed by consolidation chemotherapy with VEMP (vindesine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and prednisolone) or VQEP (vindesine, carbazilquinone, cyclophosphamide and prednisolone). Twenty-one of the 25 patients who completed post-operative chemotherapy were free of relapse 26-203 (median 94) months after the gastrectomy. Of the four patients who did not complete the projected chemotherapy, two relapsed and died of lymphoma. Another patient with recurrent lymphoma died in an accident, and the fourth patient was in remission at 54 months after surgery. The post-operative overall and disease-free survival rates at 10 years for the 25 evaluable patients were 81.6% and 92.0% respectively. Major surgical complications and treatment-related death after chemotherapy were not observed. PGL (stage II) appears to be curable when treated with gastrectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0095-a" xlink:role="1485"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1484" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1485" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1486" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1487" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00175-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1488" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
