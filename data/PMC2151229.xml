Patients with SCLC relapsing within 3 months of cytotoxic therapy received paclitaxel 175 mg m(-2) intravenously over 3 h every 3 weeks. The dose of paclitaxel was adjusted to the toxicity encountered in the previous cycle. Of 24 patients entered into the study, 24 and 21 were assessable for response and toxicity respectively. There were two early deaths and two toxic deaths. No complete and seven partial responses (29%) (95%CI 12-51%) were observed and five patients had disease stabilization. The median survival (n = 21) was 100 days. Life-threatening toxicity occurred in four patients; in others (non)-haematological toxicity was manageable. Paclitaxel is active in drug-resistant SCLC. Further investigation in combination with other active agents in this poor prognosis group is appropriate.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00078-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="347" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00078-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="348" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00078-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="349" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00078-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="350" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00078-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="351" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
