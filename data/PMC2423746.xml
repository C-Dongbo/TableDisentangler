		<p>Debate continues regarding the optimal management of irresectable malignant proximal biliary
obstruction. Controversy exists concerning the ability of unilateral drainage to provide adequate
biliary decompression with tumors that have occluded the communication between the right and
left hepatic ductal systems.</p>
		<p>Between October 1986 and October 1989, 18 patients with malignant proximal biliary
obstruction were treated by an intrahepatic biliary enteric bypass. Patients were divided into two
groups based on the presence or absence of a communication between the right and left biliary
systems. In Group I (<italic>n</italic> = 9), there was free communication; and in Group II (<italic>n</italic> = 9) there was no
communication. There were two perioperative deaths (11%) one due to persistent cholangitis
and the other to myocardial insufficiency both with one death in each group. The median
survival (excluding perioperative deaths) was 5.6 months. Comparison of pre- and postoperative
serum levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase showed a significant decrease in each group,
but no difference between the groups in the size of the reduction. Sixteen patients survived at least
three months and the palliation was judged as excellent in eight, fair in five, and unchanged
in three.</p>
		<p>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of biliary enteric bypass regardless of communication
between the left and right biliary ductal systems.</p>
