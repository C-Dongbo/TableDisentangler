The maximum tolerated dose was 6 g m-2, above which dose-limiting hepatic toxicity was observed. Patient tolerance was significantly better using the 36 h infusion compared to patients receiving the drug by a 30 min infusion; in particular, there were no reports of nausea or vomiting. No responses were seen in these patients. Detailed pharmacokinetics were performed at 6 g m-2 comparing the 36 h and 30 min infusions in four patients. Parent drug AUC values were lower for the 36 h infusion, 67.8 micrograms ml-1 h-1 compared to 232 micrograms ml-1 h-1 for the 30 min infusion. AUC values for the 3-hydroxy metabolite were much higher following the 36 h infusion: 55.4 compared to 18.6 micrograms ml-1 h-1. In contrast, the amide metabolite was not detected following the 36 h infusion, but AUC values of 23 micrograms ml-1 h-1 were seen after the 30 min infusion. The mean peak plasma level was 72 micrograms ml-1 following 6 g m-2 given by a 30 min infusion compared to 2.8 micrograms ml-1 following the prolonged infusion. Clearance was higher following the 36 h infusion: 97.6 versus 24.4 l h-1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00223-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="447" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00223-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="448" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00223-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="449" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00223-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="450" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
