In this study risk perceptions and anxiety of 99 'at risk' women participating in the Tamoxifen Prevention Trial were compared with those of 87 'at risk' women not attending any specialist clinic who were recruited from the National Breast Screening Programme (NBSP). Most anxiety was found in NBSP women with a family history. Women attending the family history clinic and participating in the trial had anxiety scores comparable with 86 women recruited from the NBSP who did not have a family history. We conclude that such specialist clinics do not see a selected group of the most anxious 'at risk' women nor does participation in tamoxifen prevention programmes appear to increase anxiety.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00039-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1422" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00039-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1423" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00039-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1424" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
