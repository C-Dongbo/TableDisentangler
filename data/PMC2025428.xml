MER (methanol extraction residue of BCG). MER was administered by i.v. infusion over a 4-h period, twice a week, in dosages varying from 0.05 mg to 1.25 mg. The skin reactivity to 5 recall antigens was evaluated in the patients. All patients except 4 were anergic. Twelve patients had no side-effects. Anergic patients had less side-effects than ergic patients. The side-effects recorded in the others were fever, chills, vomiting and tachycardia. The reaction subsided within 24 h after treatment and was tolerable for most patients. In 2 patients an objective improvement was observed. No changes in cutaneous reactivity, renal and hepatic functions were found. A significant increase in peripheral leucocyte count was noted in two patients and slight a increase in the remainder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="341" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="342" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="343" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="344" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="345" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00294-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="346" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
