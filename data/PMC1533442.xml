Soil from a residential yard at a mining-impacted federal Superfund site that had negligible amounts of other priority pollutants was dried and screened through a 25-micron mesh sieve. The &#x0003c; 250-micron fraction, which likely represents that ingested via hand-to-mouth activity, was then sterilized by exposure to radiation. Ten replicate samples yielded a mean (SD) soil Pb concentration of 2924 +/- 36 ppm, and a mean 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.1083 +/- 0.0002, indicating remarkable soil homogeneity. Six adults with 206Pb/207Pb ratios of &#x0003e; 1.190 were admitted to the clinical research center and fasted overnight prior to dosing with 250 micrograms Pb/70 kg bw (i.e., 85.5 mg soil/70 kg) in a gelatin capsule. Blood for Pb and 206Pb/207Pb ratios was obtained at 14 time points through 30 hr. Results of the isotopic analyses from these subjects indicate that on average 26.2% +/- 8.1 of the administered dose was absorbed. Six additional subjects were subsequently studied but ingested soil immediately after a standardized breakfast. Bioavailability in this group was only 2.52% +/- 1.7. Collectively, this study provides the first experimental estimates of soil Pb absorption in humans, and should allow for more precise estimates of health risks due to Pb-contaminated soil.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0321-a" xlink:role="1590"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0322-a" xlink:role="1591"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0322-b" xlink:role="1591"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0320.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1589" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0321.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1590" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0322.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1591" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0323.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1592" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0324.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1593" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00541-0325.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1594" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
