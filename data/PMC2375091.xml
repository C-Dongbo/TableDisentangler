Between June 1996 and July 1998, 62 patients with NSCLC who had not received previous chemotherapy for advanced disease were enrolled in this study. 59 patients (22 stage IIIB and 37 stage IV) were eligible for the evaluation of efficacy and safety. S-1 was administered orally, twice daily, after meals. 3 dosages of S-1 were prescribed according to body surface area (BSA) so that they would be approximately equivalent to 80&#x02008;mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>: BSA &#x0003c; 1.25&#x02008;m<sup>2</sup>, 40&#x02008;mg b.i.d.; BSA<underline>&#x02265;</underline>1.25 but &#x0003c;1.5&#x02008;m<sup>2</sup>; 50&#x02008;mg b.i.d., and BSA<underline>&#x02265;</underline>1.5&#x02008;m<sup>2</sup>: 60&#x02008;mg b.i.d. One cycle consisted of consecutive administration of S-1 for 28 days followed by a 2-week rest period, and cycles were repeated up to 4 times. The partial response (PR) rate of the eligible patients was 22.0&#x00025; (13/59); (95&#x00025; confidence interval: 12.3&#x02013;34.7&#x00025;). A PR was observed in 22.7&#x00025; (5/22) of the stage IIIB patients and 21.6&#x00025; (8/37) of the stage IV patients. The median response duration was 3.4 months (1.1&#x02013;13.7 months or longer). Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in one of the 59 patients (1.7&#x00025;). The grade 3 or 4 toxicities consisted of decreased haemoglobin level in 1.7&#x00025; of patients (1/59), neutropenia in 6.8&#x00025; (4/59), thrombocytopenia in 1.7&#x00025; (1/59), anorexia in 10.2&#x00025; (6/59), diarrhoea in 8.5&#x00025; (5/59), stomatitis in 1.7&#x00025; (1/59), and malaise in 6.8&#x00025; (4/59), and their incidences were relatively low. There were no irreversible, severe or unexpected toxicities. The median survival time (MST) of all patients was 10.2 months (95&#x00025; confidence interval: 7.7&#x02013;14.5 months), and the one-year survival rate was 41.1&#x00025;. The MST of the stage IIIB patients was 7.9 months, and that of the stage IV patients was 11.1 months. The one-year survival rates of the stage IIIB and IV patients were 30.7&#x00025; and 47.4&#x00025;, respectively. S-1 was considered to be an active single agent against NSCLC. Further study of S-1 with other active agents is warranted. &#x000a9; 2001 Cancer Research Campaign<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bjcancer.com">http://www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NSCLC</kwd><kwd>tegafur</kwd><kwd>CDHP</kwd><kwd>S-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
