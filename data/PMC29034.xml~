		  conventional airway management of trauma patients to avoid secondary
		  neurological deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A degree of
		  potentially hazardous head extension may still be necessary for laryngeal
		  visualization, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Head and neck stabilization
		  may prevent the alignment of mouth and glottis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Poor
		  laryngeal visualization is frequently associated with excessive laryngoscope
		  blade levering motion (LBLM) and subsequent risk of upper teeth or gum trauma
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we performed laryngoscopy with a no. 4 standard
		  and a no. 4 modified curved blade in elective surgery patients under simulated
		  cervical spine precautions. The modified blade carries two no. 10 Foley
		  catheters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and is a partial development of a new
		  laryngoscope (international patent document no. 98/19589) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The standard balloon laryngoscopy technique includes
		  modified blade tip insertion into the vallecula, right catheter balloon
		  inflation with 2ml air (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and blade elevation to
		  achieve the best laryngeal view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In patients with
		  anterior larynx, the lifting of the epiglottis is facilitated by establishing
		  adequate contact between the inflated balloon's upper surface and the
		  tongue base and hyoid bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that balloon laryngoscopy might result in less head
		  extension and LBLM, because balloon inflation and subsequent blade elevation
		  should facilitate laryngeal exposure and reduce the extent of the necessary
		  laryngoscopic manoeuvres.</p><p>We determined the head extension and LBLM needed for maximal glottic
		  exposure with both blades, the laryngoscopic view grade during each
		  laryngoscopy and oxygen saturation. The present results showed significant
		  reduction in the head extension and LBLM angles during balloon
		  laryngoscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Ethics committee approval and informed, written patient consent were
		  obtained. The enrollees were adult males, classified as American Society of
		  Anesthesiologists physical status I, and were scheduled for elective surgery
		  that required general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Exclusion
		  criteria were a history of cervical spine pathology, any condition predisposing
		  to pulmonary aspiration and previous difficult intubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. All patients had Mallampati class I oropharyngeal views
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], head extension was greater than 35&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], thyromental distance was greater than 6.5 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], sternomental distance was greater than 13.5 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], maximal incisal opening was greater then 4 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and body mass index was less than
		  27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The operating table was kept parallel to the operating room floor
		  (defined as horizontal plane) as follows: an automatic angle finder (serial no
		  295; Fisher Instruments, Kent, UK), detached from its metallic ruler (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), was sequentially placed on the right-long and
		  cephalad-short sides of the table's metallic frame; and each time the
		  table's inclination was adjusted until the angle finder read 0&#x000b0;.</p><p>Patients lay supine with their heads flat on the operating table.
		  Before induction of anaesthesia, a piece of adhesive tape (1.2&#x000d7;5cm) was
		  placed on the right patient cheek with its median longitudinal axis parallel to
		  the occlusal surface of the maxillary molars (or gums; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Standard monitoring (including pulse oximetry) was
		  used.</p><p>After 5 min preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, anaesthesia was induced
		  with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc; g/kg) and propofol (2.5 mg/kg). After the disappearance
		  of the eyelid reflex, a rigid board was placed under each patients'
		  shoulders and occiput [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and a rigid Philadelphia
		  collar was fitted around their necks. Airway instrumentation was facilitated
		  with intravenous succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). After the disappearance of the
		  fasciculations in the face, the patient head was placed in the neutral position
		  by aligning the occlusal surface of the maxillary molars' perpendicular
		  to the operating table as follows: the angle finder's 'vertical
		  arm' (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was placed on the longitudinal axis of
		  the adhesive tape (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and the head was manipulated
		  until the angle finder read 0&#x000b0;. Subsequently, laryngoscopy was performed
		  with both standard and modified blades in randomized order. In between
		  laryngoscopies, neutral head position was resumed.</p><p>Balloon laryngoscopy technique consisted of modified blade tip
		  insertion into the vallecula, right catheter balloon inflation with 2 ml air,
		  and blade elevation until maximal glottic exposure was achieved. The angles of
		  the laryngoscope handle and the maxillary molars' occlusal surface
		  relative to horizontal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; angles &#x000e2;<sub>1</sub>
		  and &#x000e2;<sub>2</sub>, respectively) were measured with the angle finder upon
		  maximal glottic exposure with each blade. To measure the angle of the handle
		  relative to horizontal, the angle finder's metallic ruler was placed on
		  the median longitudinal axis of the handle's posterior aspect. All
		  patients were intubated during the second laryngoscopy immediately after
		  measurements were taken.</p><p>Airway instrumentation was performed by a senior anesthesiologist
		  (MPB), who had a prior experience of more than 200 balloon laryngoscopies. The
		  measured angles, the best laryngoscopic view during each laryngoscopy and
		  oxygen saturation throughout the study were recorded. The laryngoscopic view
		  was graded with the use of a modified grading scale (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) proposed by SDM and MJJ.</p><p>The difference '90&#x000b0;-&#x000e2;<sub>2</sub>' was defined
		  as head extension angle, and the difference
		  '&#x000e2;<sub>1</sub>-&#x000e2;<sub>2</sub>' was defined as the LBLM
		  angle. The LBLM angle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; angle &#x000e2;<sub>3</sub>)
		  is formed between the occlusal surface axis of the maxillary molars or gums
		  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; line OS) and a chord (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; line CH) that is perpendicular to the axis of the handle
		  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; line AH) and corresponds to the radian formed by
		  the proximal one-third of the convex surface of the blade. This chord passes
		  through the distal end point of the radian (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; point
		  E).</p><p>The maximal acceptable laryngoscopy duration and time between the two
		  laryngoscopies were 30s, and the maximal allowable study procedure duration was
		  180s. Procedure timing began upon succinylcholine administration.</p><p>Data from patients with laryngeal views differing by two or more
		  consecutive grades between the two laryngoscopies(eg grade I and grade
		  II<sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) were excluded from the subsequent statistical analysis
		  (see Discussion). The head extension and LBLM angles with each laryngoscope
		  blade were calculated and compared with the paired <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic>
		  &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventeen adult male patients were studied, and no patients were
		  excluded from the analysis because of differences in the laryngoscopic view
		  grade. Mean patient age and body mass index were 28.1years (range 22&#x02013;39years)
		  and 23.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range 20.5-26.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), respectively. In
		  all patients, the laryngoscopic view grades were virtually identical and grade
		  IIa or less with both blades, the study procedure lasted less than 120s, and
		  oxygen saturation remained greater than 97%. The values of the head extension
		  and LBLM angles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) were normally distributed.
		  According to the present data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Table
		  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), balloon laryngoscopy resulted in significantly
		  reduced head extension (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and LBLM
		  (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current investigation, we determined the potentially beneficial
		  effects of the use of a curved blade modified to improve laryngeal
		  visualization by balloon inflation on the cervical spine motion and LBLM under
		  simulated cervical spine precautions. The present data showed a 40-50%
		  reduction in the head extension and LBLM angles with balloon laryngoscopy
		  (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This might be due to reduced need to manoeuvre
		  the modified blade while exposing the glottis.</p><p>The estimated incidence of difficult laryngoscopy [grade
		  III<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> or less (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)] in general
		  surgery patients is approximately 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The use of
		  neutral head position along with cervical spine stabilization manoeuvres has
		  resulted in an incidence of 4.3&#x02013;16.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The 0% incidence in the current study may be due to the
		  combined use of multiple difficult airway predictors during patient selection,
		  and the relatively small patient number (<italic>n</italic> = 17). Additionally, the
		  maintenance of oxygen saturation above 97% throughout the study procedure was
		  to be expected, because the safe duration of apnea tolerance in non-obese,
		  American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I patients exceeds 4min
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>It seemed sensible to compare head extension and LBLM angles only if
		  laryngeal exposure was maximal and approximately identical during both
		  laryngoscopies in all patients. Maximal values would then be achieved in both
		  angles. If in some patients the larynx were partly (or not at all) exposed, the
		  head extension would probably be less than if the full view were obtained
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, the head extension angles would be
		  falsely underestimated during the laryngoscopy with the least glottic exposure
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The risk of this bias would increase in patients
		  with predicted difficult laryngoscopy. In such patients, conventional
		  laryngoscopy might result in lesser laryngeal exposure than is achieved with
		  balloon laryngoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the increased
		  difficulty in laryngeal visualization might result in excessive LBLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]
		  and subsequent overestimation of the 'conventional' LBLM angles.
		  Thus, we studied patients with 'easy' airways in order to maximize
		  the probability of obtaining satisfactory (grade II<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> or
		  greater, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and similar laryngoscopic views with
		  both blades.</p><p>External head extension angles during laryngoscopy with different
		  blades and with or without cervical spine stabilization have been measured in
		  two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the
		  study by Hastings and Wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the head extension angles
		  for best laryngeal view during conventional laryngoscopy under manual head
		  immobilization (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation 9 &#x000b1; 6 &#x000b0;) were similar to
		  ours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The smaller coefficient of variation
		  (defined as standard deviation/mean value) of the present results (0.19 versus
		  0.67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]) may be due to the following: all laryngoscopies
		  were performed by one experienced operator, whereas in the previous study
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] 62 laryngoscopies were performed by 16 operators; and
		  the use of a hard collar for cervical spine stabilization, which has eliminated
		  the potential variability in angle measurements caused by differences in the
		  force applied by different assistants performing head immobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Head extension is the major external movement that occurs during
		  airway management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Also, the externally measured head
		  extension angle during laryngoscopy has been correlated with the angle formed
		  between the occiput and the fourth cervical vertebra (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>
		   = 0.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The maximum allowable head extension during
		  airway management of trauma victims and the actual risk of neurological
		  deterioration associated with conventional airway management techniques applied
		  in cervical spine-injured patients still remain to be determined, however.</p><p>In the current study, we also determined the LBLM, which has not been
		  previously determined under simulated cervical spine precautions. LBLM was
		  defined by SDM and MJJ as the backward motion of the blade's convex
		  surface toward the maxilla. Its range was estimated by measuring the angle
		  between the occlusal surface axis of the maxillary molars and the chord of the
		  radian formed by the proximal one-third of the blade (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This chord is the best straight-line approximation to the
		  geometrical shape of the proximal one-third of the blade's convex
		  surface. This portion of the no. 4 blade is most frequently in close proximity
		  with the upper teeth of adult males during laryngoscopy, and may traumatize
		  them if excessive LBLM is employed. Upper incisor trauma and/or dislodgment may
		  then result in aspiration of tooth fragments into the trachea.</p><p>In our opinion, the potential risks of spinal cord injury and of
		  maxillary teeth dislodgement during laryngoscopy performed in trauma patients
		  under cervical spine precautions should not be underestimated (especially in
		  the presence of unstable cervical spine injuries and/or maxillary trauma),
		  despite the fact that they have not yet been accurately determined.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that the head extension and LBLM angles
		  are significantly reduced when balloon laryngoscopy is performed under
		  simulated cervical spine precautions in carefully preselected and adequately
		  anaesthetized and paralyzed elective surgery patients. Such 'ideal'
		  conditions may not be achievable in the emergency setting, however. Thus,
		  further investigation is required to prove the usefulness of balloon
		  laryngoscopy in the emergency airway management of cervical spine-injured
		  patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hastings</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Airway management for trauma patients with potential cervical spine
