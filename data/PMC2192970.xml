Four of the nine were  human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen DR13&#x02013;positive, as compared with only 1/31 nonreactors. The other five reactors expressed either DR1 or DR4. To confirm major histocompatibility complex restriction, fibroblast cell lines transfected with HLA-DR molecules were  used to present FC1Ps to cat allergen&#x02013;specific T cell lines derived from subjects before peptide injection. FC1P3 (peptide 28&#x02013;44 of Fel d 1 chain 1) was recognized in the context of DR13 alleles  (DRB1*1301, 1302) and induced specific T cell proliferation and IL-5 production. T cells from a  DR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> responder proliferated and produced IL-5 in the presence of FC1P3 and DR1  (DRB1*0101) fibroblast cell lines, whereas T cells from a DR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subject recognized FC1P2 (peptide 22&#x02013;37) when presented by DRB1*0405. We conclude that short, allergen-derived peptides  can directly initiate a major histocompatibility complex&#x02013;restricted, T cell&#x02013;dependent late asthmatic reaction, without the requirement for an early IgE/mast cell&#x02013;dependent response, in sensitized asthmatic subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>Fel d 1</kwd><kwd>allergen</kwd><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>human histocompatibility leukocyte  antigen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Allergen challenge of sensitized atopic individuals results  in an early response, which in the skin is seen as the  immediate wheal and flare reaction, and, after inhalation, as  a decrease in airway caliber occurring within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).  These acute reactions are generally considered to be due to  the release of histamine and other pharmacological agents  from mast cells subsequent to IgE cross-linking. 3&#x02013;8 h after  allergen challenge, there follows a late-phase reaction (LPR)<sup>1</sup>  characterized in the skin by swelling and induration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and  in the lung by the late asthmatic reaction (LAR). LPRs are  accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, in particular  eosinophils and Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and have been used as  models of chronic allergic inflammation. There is continued debate as to the relative contributions of IgE-dependent versus T cell&#x02013;dependent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the LPR. On the one hand, a cutaneous LPR could  be transferred by IgE or injection of anti-IgE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>),  whereas we and others have provided extensive evidence  that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are associated with the LPR and chronic  asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Furthermore, in animal models, airway eosinophil responses and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled antigen challenge could be adoptively transferred by  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>To provide evidence that the LPR can be provoked by T  cell activation independently of the early IgE response, we  have administered peptide epitopes derived from the major  cat allergen, Fel d 1, to cat-allergic asthmatics. The peptides  were capable of inducing T cell proliferation but did not  cross-link IgE, as shown by the basophil histamine release assay. We hypothesized that the peptides would elicit isolated  late cutaneous reactions after intradermal injection, without a  preceding wheal and flare reaction. Unexpectedly, we observed that intradermal injection of the T cell peptide  epitopes produced isolated LARs with no visible cutaneous  response. These reactions were only observed in a minority  of &#x02009;the subjects challenged. In this report, we describe these  isolated LARs provoked by T cell peptide epitopes and provide evidence that they are HLA restricted. We also present  preliminary observations on hyporesponsiveness (&#x0201c;tolerance&#x0201d;)  after subsequent rechallenge with the peptides.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Human Subjects.</title><p>40 cat-allergic asthmatic patients were recruited from the Allergy Clinic, Royal Brompton Hospital, London and by advertisement. The study was approved by the Royal  Brompton Hospital Ethics Committee, and informed consent  was obtained from all patients. Subjects were nonsmokers and  had no other significant illness. Inhaled corticosteroids were discontinued at least 2 d before assessment, and oral corticosteroids  were discontinued 3 mo before assessment. Patients were specifically instructed not to take antihistamines, corticosteroids, or any  other medication for the duration of the study. Volunteers had a  history of wheezing on exposure to cats and demonstrated airway  hyperresponsiveness, with a provocative concentration (PC)<sub>20</sub> of  &#x0003c;4 mg/ml methacholine, and &#x0003e;20% reversibility with inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>  agonists. Cat allergy was confirmed by a positive radio allergo  sorbent test (&#x0003e;0.35 IU/ml; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>) and skin prick test to  whole cat dander (ALK) and a late phase skin reaction of &#x02009;&#x0003e;3 cm  diameter at 6 h, after the intradermal testing of &#x02009;30 biological units  of whole cat dander (containing 4.5 ng Fel d 1) in 0.03 ml. The vehicle for whole cat dander extract contained 0.3 mg/ml human  serum albumin and 4 mg/ml phenol (ALK diluent; ALK).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Study Design.</title><p>On the first visit (control day), subjects were  skin tested with intradermal cat dander. Peripheral blood (150 ml)  was taken for HLA typing, histamine release assays, and proliferation assays. Local reactions were observed after 5, 15, and 30 min  and hourly for 6 h thereafter. At these times, FEV<sub>1</sub> and peak expiratory flow rate were also recorded. On the second visit, patients  received 40 &#x003bc;g intradermally of the three peptides comprising  FC1P, contained in 25 &#x003bc;l, into each forearm. Local reactions were  observed at the same time points as the control day. A positive reaction was defined as a fall in forced volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of &#x02009;20% or  more. The time interval between the two study days ranged from  4 to 56 d (average, 17 d). Six of the nine subjects who developed  LARs after peptide injections had a further visit in which 0.03 ml  of diluent (vehicle) was injected intradermally. Three subjects, having developed LAR after FC1P administration, were recalled for a  repeat administration of the peptides 2&#x02013;6 wk after the initial challenge. An additional three subjects received a repeat administration  of FC1P a minimum of &#x02009;12 mo after the first injection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical Analysis of LARs.</title><p>FEV<sub>1</sub> data was summarized over  time for each subject for the control and peptide days. Areas under  each curve were calculated using the trapezoidal rule to generate  area under curve (AUC).

They were  purified to &#x0003e;95% by HPLC, subjected to sequence and mass analysis, and subjected to independent analysis for sterility and the absence of endotoxin. Peptides were reconstituted in ALK diluent at  1.6 mg/ml. Peptides for in vitro analysis were synthesized using  F-moc chemistry at the Advanced Biotechnology Centre, Imperial  College School of Medicine, Charing Cross Campus. Peptide sequences used in this study were: FC1P1, LFLTGTPDEYVEQVAQY; FC1P2, EQVAQYKALPVVLENA; and FC1P3, KALPVVLENARILKNCV.

Samples were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation. Supernatants were transferred to glass microfiber&#x02013;coated  microtiter plate wells (REFLAB), together with 50 &#x003bc;l of a histamine standard solution (50 ng/ml). Plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for  60 min, washed twice (45 s) in distilled water, and air dried before  measurement of histamine by spectrofluorimetry. Percentage of  &#x02009;histamine release for each control and test substance was calculated  from the mean histamine release (ng/ml) values using the equation:  % release &#x0003d; [(sample &#x02212; spontaneous)/(total &#x02212; spontaneous)] &#x000d7; 100.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Transfected Fibroblast Cell Lines.</title><p>Murine and human fibroblast cell lines transfected with HLA-DR molecules were obtained  as gifts from a number of sources: DRB1*0101, 0401, 0403, 0404,  and 0406 from Prof. R.I.

Cells from  11 subjects (5 FC1P reactors and 6 nonreactors) were incubated with FC1Ps at five increasing concentrations up to  100 &#x003bc;g/ml (&#x0223c;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M of each of the pooled peptides).  Whole cat dander extract served as a positive control, releasing histamine in all subjects assayed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). No immediate skin or asthmatic reactions were observed in vivo,  further demonstrating that FC1P did not bind IgE. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>FC1Ps Induce Primary Proliferative Responses in PBMC  Culture.</title><p>The ability of FC1Ps to stimulate T cell responses was assessed, initially by primary in vitro proliferation assays. All individuals assayed responded to one or  more of the three peptides, although none of the peptides  induced proliferation in all individuals, suggesting MHC-restricted recognition. Each of the peptides was recognized  by PBMCs from both the group developing LARs (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7)  and the nonresponder group (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 19). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>,  each peptide was able to induce proliferative responses, in a  dose-dependent fashion, in PBMCs from representative  (26/40) cat-asthmatic subjects from whom cells were available. Proliferative responses from individuals who developed LARs were generally of greater magnitude than those  that did not; however, this difference was not statistically  significant. All subjects responded to the positive control  recall antigen, PPD. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Intradermal Administration of &#x02009;Peptides Derived from Fel d 1  Induced Isolated LARs.</title><p>Inhaled whole allergen induces  both an immediate early asthmatic reaction and an LAR.  To determine whether T cell activation could trigger an  isolated LAR, sensitized volunteers were challenged with  peptides derived from Fel d 1 chain 1. In 9/40 subjects, 80  &#x003bc;g of &#x02009;FC1P did not produce a visible immediate or late  skin reaction but did elicit a progressive decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>,  associated, in all responders, with symptoms of chest tightness and wheezing. The remaining subjects did not develop  any immediate or late bronchial or cutaneous reactions to  the peptides. The reaction commenced at hours 2&#x02013;3 and  reached a plateau by hour 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>  observed ranged from 21 to 64% of &#x02009;baseline.

Additionally, six of the nine  reactors had a further control day in which 0.03 ml of the  diluent (vehicle) was injected intradermally. The mean  maximum change in FEV<sub>1</sub> was &#x02212;6.3% (range from 0 to  &#x02013;13%). 31 individuals showed no evidence of&#x02009; LAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Subjects Who Developed an LAR Demonstrated a Higher  Frequency of HLA-DR13 than Nonreactors.</title><p>To determine  whether the reactions were HLA restricted, subjects were  typed for HLA-DRB1.

For this purpose, fibroblast cell lines  transfected with relevant HLA molecules were cultured together with each peptide and T cell lines from the responding individuals. Cat dander extract&#x02013;specific T cell lines  were derived from a DR13<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subject (RO3; DRB1*1301)  before induction of peptide-induced LAR. Culture of  these cells with FC1Ps and a fibroblast cell line transfected  with DRA and DRB1*1301 resulted in T cell proliferation  and IL-5 secretion in response to FC1P3 but not to FC1P1  or FC1P2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). Fibroblasts transfected with DRA and  DRB1*0101 were able to present FC1P3 to a cat dander  extract&#x02013;specific T cell line derived from subject RO2  (DRB1*0101), resulting in proliferation and IL-5 production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). T cells from a cat dander extract&#x02013;specific  cell line from subject RO7 (DRB1*0405) were induced to  proliferate and release IL-5 when cultured with FC1P2  and fibroblasts expressing DRB1*0405 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Degenerate T Cell Recognition of FC1P3 on Closely Related  DR13 and DR4 Microvariants.</title><p>Fibroblast cell lines transfected with either DRB1*1301 or DRB1*1302 were assayed  for their ability to present FC1P3 to allergen extract&#x02013;specific  T cells derived from a DRB1*1301 donor. As previously described, FC1P3 presented by DRB1*1301 induced a proliferative response in autologous T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). In addition,  fibroblasts expressing DRB1*1302 were able to activate  allergen-specific T cells from a DRB1*1301 donor (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). In the absence of fibroblasts expressing DRB1*0408,  cells expressing the closely related microvariant DRB1*0405  were assayed for their ability to present FC1P2 to cat allergen  extract&#x02013;specific T cells from a DRB1*0408 donor. As shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B, DRB1*0405, which differs from DRB1*0408 by  only one residue in the peptide binding groove (position 57,  serine&#x02192; aspartic acid), was able to present FC1P2, inducing  proliferation in T cells from a DRB1*0408 donor. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Repeat Administration of &#x02009;Peptides Leads to Transient Attenuation of the Initial Reaction.</title><p>To study the reproducibility  of peptide-induced LAR, three subjects (RO1, RO4, and  RO5) received a second intradermal dose of 80 &#x003bc;g of  FC1P between 2 and 6 wk after the first injection. A  marked attenuation of the initial LAR was observed. The  maximum percentage changes in FEV<sub>1</sub> on the first peptide  versus the second peptide challenge were &#x02212;28 vs. &#x02212;9  (R01), &#x02212;21 vs. &#x02212;10 (R04), and &#x02212;51 vs. &#x02212;9 (R05), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). After an interval of at least 12 mo after the initial FC1P challenge, three subjects received a further challenge of the same dose. All experienced LARs of similar  magnitude to those after the initial injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that peptides derived  from a major allergen elicited an LAR in a proportion of  sensitized individuals. That the peptides were most likely to  initiate these reactions by direct activation of T cells, rather  than mast cells or basophils, is supported by (a) the lack of  IgE-mediated histamine release in vitro, (b) the absence of  a wheal and flare reaction at the site of injection, and (c) the  absence of an early asthmatic reaction. In addition, we have  demonstrated HLA restriction of &#x02009;T cell responses to peptides FC1P2 and FC1P3 on the basis of fibroblast presentation assays. These observations provide direct evidence for  the central role of &#x02009;T lymphocytes in the induction of the  late asthmatic response and indicate that these reactions are  MHC-restricted events. Although we had a control day for  six of the nine responders that included the injection of  &#x02009;human serum albumin, we did not specifically employ a  control peptide. Some small peptides cause histamine release from mast cells, but because the action of histamine is  immediate, this would not be relevant to the LAR, which  commences at hour 2&#x02013;3 and continues to hour 6. A peptide of &#x0201c;irrelevant&#x0201d; sequence would not be informative, as  the biological actions are sequence dependent. On the other  hand, as we demonstrate MHC restriction of &#x02009;T cell recognition, control peptide(s) would need to be immunologically  inactive but capable of &#x02009;binding to the same range of MHC  molecules as the FC1Ps and with similar affinities.</p><p>There is strong circumstantial evidence to support a role  for T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This  includes elevated numbers of activated T cells in the blood  of patients with acute severe asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), as well as studies  using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsies  from mild asthmatics in which increases in CD3/CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  cells expressing mRNA positive for IL-4 and IL-5 cells  were demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In a provoked model of  asthma, increased numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in BAL after allergen challenge were also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Furthermore, the  allergen-induced late-phase, but not the early-phase, reaction was inhibited by prior administration of cyclosporin A,  a compound with major inhibitory effects on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). More recently, a single infusion of humanized anti-CD4 mAbs into patients with chronic asthma was associated with significant improvements in lung function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).  In Brown Norway rats, Watanabe et al. showed increases  in airway resistance up to 8 h after adoptive transfer of CD4  but not CD8 T cells and subsequent allergen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).  Adoptive transfer experiments in mice have also demonstrated that baseline airway hyperresponsiveness was T cell  dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In animal models, initial administration of peptides in  sensitized mice can induce activation of primed T cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, subsequent administration leads to the induction of tolerance, not only to the peptide but to the  whole allergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Using cat-sensitive asthmatics, Norman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) attempted to induce the counterpart of murine experimental T cell tolerance in human atopic allergic  individuals by subcutaneous injection of &#x02009;two peptides  (termed IPC1 and IPC2) spanning a large proportion of  chain 1 of &#x02009;Fel d 1. Although there was some subjective  symptomatic improvement, many patients reported &#x0201c;allergic&#x0201d; symptoms that occurred between 10 min and 6 h after  subcutaneous injections. Other groups, using the same  peptides, reported similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). As IPC1 and  IPC2 are 27 residues long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), it is possible that the immediate reactions were the result of IgE binding, and the late  reactions were due to T cell activation. For this reason, in  this study, we specifically designed peptides of relatively  small size (16/17 residues) and linear configuration to enable them to be presented to T cells in the absence of antigen processing and without binding to IgE.</p><p>This approach, using T cell&#x02013;reactive peptide epitopes  that do not cross-link IgE, provides evidence that asthma  can be provoked without initial mast cell activation. The  mechanism of T cell peptide&#x02013;induced LPRs, however, remains to be elucidated. One explanation is that T cell activation in the airways leads to mobilization of eosinophils  through the elaboration of&#x02009; type 2 and eosinophil active cytokines (i.e., IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF). Together,  these are known to promote selective eosinophil accumulation, migration, activation, and subsequent tissue injury,  possibly through the generation of membrane-derived sulphidopeptide leukotrienes as well as the release of &#x02009;basic  proteins from the eosinophil crystalloid granule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, T cell activation may be associated  with the generation of histamine releasing factors, which in  turn activate basophils and/or mast cells to release histamine with subsequent narrowing of already hyperresponsive airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Direct triggering of &#x02009;bronchoconstriction  by release of an unidentified T cell mediator may be another  possible mechanism. Studies currently underway involving  fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL and bronchial biopsy,  performed at time intervals after peptide-induced LAR, will  enable us to test these hypotheses. Our findings are thus of  clinical significance, because they may help to identify the  critical mediator(s) involved in T cell&#x02013; as opposed to mast  cell&#x02013;dependent airway narrowing. This may have particular  relevance to ongoing chronic asthma, which is believed to  have an important T cell component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) but where the  sequence of events between T cell activation and bronchial  obstruction are incompletely understood.</p><p>It is intriguing that intradermal injection of peptides produced no visible local reaction in the nine subjects but  caused marked changes in the airways. One explanation for  a reaction at a distal site is that peptides are presented by  skin Langerhans cells to circulating T lymphocytes that bear  putative T cell homing receptors (analogous to the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen described in patients  with atopic dermatitis; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and that these then  traffic to the airways. Alternatively, the peptide may be absorbed via the circulation or lymphatics and reach the airways, where they are taken up by bronchial APCs that in  turn interact with locally sensitized T cells.</p><p>Related to the mechanism of T cell peptide epitope&#x02013; induced asthma is the variation in responsiveness amongst  the subjects studied, with only 9/40 responding with an  isolated LAR. There was no association between the ability  of a particular peptide to elicit a T cell&#x02013;dependent proliferative response in vitro and its capacity to evoke LAR after  intradermal injection in vivo, i.e., in vitro mitogenic responses were observed in the absence of an elicited in vivo  effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These findings cannot be explained solely by  the lack of the appropriate HLA haplotype in the nonresponders, as many of these also expressed DR1, DR4, or  DR13 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). We believe that responsiveness or nonresponsiveness was likely to have been a reflection of the dose  of peptide administered, with the threshold for developing  an LAR varying amongst individuals. It is clear that T cell reactivity is likely to have been dependent on HLA molecules  restricting peptide presentation and T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) to  FC1P, with subsequent induction of isolated LARs in subjects in which a threshold dose was achieved. Of interest in  this regard was the apparent clustering of HLA-DR13  amongst the subjects in whom these LPRs were observed.  Haplotyping of reactors indicated that 4/9 reactors (44%)  possessed a DR13 allele, compared with only one 1/30 (3%)  nonreactors. Using transfected fibroblast cell lines, the ability of a variety of HLA-DR molecules to present FC1Ps to  allergen-specific T cell lines raised from subjects who developed LARs has been assessed. Initially, based upon the  high frequency of DR13 among those who developed  LARs, we examined the ability of DRB1*1301 and 1302  to present one or more of the FC1Ps to cat allergen extract&#x02013; specific T cell lines. We demonstrated that FC1P3 could be  presented by both DRB1*1301 and 1302. These microvariants of DR13 differ by only one residue at position 86  (valine&#x02192; glycine; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A), and our results suggest, therefore, that this residue is not critical for the binding of this  peptide. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the ability  of DRB1*1302 to present FC1P3 to T cells from a  DRB1*1301 donor, indicating a degree of degeneracy in T  cell recognition of this peptide in the context of closely related microvariants of &#x02009;DR13. The ability of&#x02009; DRB1*1303,  which differs from 1301 and 1302 more substantially, to  present peptide FC1P3 is currently under investigation.</p><p>Investigation of the ability of DRB1*0101 to present  FC1Ps revealed promiscuous binding of FC1P3 to both  DR1 and DR13 molecules. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a, the sequences of DRB1*0101 and DRB1*1301/1302 differ substantially within the peptide binding region of the molecules. However, a precedent for promiscuous binding of a  single peptide (influenza HA 307&#x02013;319) to both DR1 and  DR13 alleles has been described by Hickling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).  Three of the nine individuals who developed peptide- induced LAR were DR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, although each expressed a different microvariant of DR4 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). The ability of &#x02009;DR4  microvariants to present FC1Ps was investigated, and it was  established that DRB1*0405 was able to present FC1P2 to  cat allergen extract&#x02013;specific T cells from both DRB1*0405  (autologous) and DRB1*0408 individuals. Thus, in common with FC1P3, the second FC1P appears to be capable  of &#x02009;binding to more than one HLA molecule. The ability of  this peptide to bind to other DR4 microvariants is currently under investigation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that induction of the LAR results  from MHC-restricted T cell activation. The limited clinical  benefit that has so far been observed with peptide immunotherapy may therefore be explained by the fact that only  a proportion of patients treated will have been capable of  reacting to the peptides, as MHC restriction has not been  accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the observation that  individual allergen peptides are capable of promiscuous  HLA binding may hold promise for the development of  MHC-restricted peptide-based therapies. All of the subjects  developing asthmatic reactions expressed DR1, 4, or 13.  However, a significant proportion of individuals who did  not react also expressed these HLA types. The fact that  these subjects did not progress to develop LARs may be  due to a deficit in the subjects' T cell repertoire. Alternatively, the lowest possible dose that was found to induce an  LAR was used in all individuals, and some of the volunteers who did not respond may have required a higher dose  of FC1P to trigger an asthmatic reaction.</p><p>It should be noted that the amount of peptide required  for systemic administration was &#x0223c;10,000 times that of the  intact protein. However, there is clearly a dilutional effect  in a situation where an intradermal injection elicits a reaction at a distal site. The minimum dose required to produce  an LAR will be calculated more accurately in studies involving direct application of peptides into the airways. It  should also be appreciated that any bronchial reaction elicited by intradermal injection of whole cat extract (which  can very occasionally occur but did not in this study)  would be predominantly anaphylactic in type, with an IgE/ mast cell&#x02013;dependent bronchospasm occurring within 30 min  and usually sooner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that an initial transient  activation of &#x02009;T cells precedes the development of hyporesponsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In support of this concept was the observation that in three of the patients studied, there was abrogation of the LAR on repeat administration of the same  dose of peptide that previously caused a 20% or greater fall  in FEV<sub>1</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). This is similar to the experience of  &#x02009;Norman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), who also observed that there was a  progressive decline in the incidence and severity of untoward symptoms after continued treatment of cat allergy  with IPC1/IPC2, suggesting but not proving that some  form of tolerance may have developed after repeated administration. In addition, three subjects who developed  LARs in response to FC1P were readministered the same  dose at an interval of greater than one year. All three developed LARs of approximately the same magnitude as those  that accompanied the initial challenge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). These observations suggest that the induction of hyporesponsiveness  after a single dose of FC1P is transient, lasting somewhere  between a few weeks and one year. Further studies are currently underway to define the precise duration of peptide-induced hyporesponsiveness in humans. This may have further clinical significance if repeated administration of MHC  class II&#x02013;restricted T cell peptide epitopes produce safe and  effective long-term &#x0201c;tolerance.&#x0201d;</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that intradermal  injection of a linear peptide sequence within an allergen at a  high dose can elicit a late-phase response by a presumed T  cell&#x02013;dependent mechanism in the absence of an IgE-mediated reaction. This appears to be the first demonstration of  asthma provoked by MHC-restricted T cell activation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>FC1Ps do not induce histamine release from basophil- enriched PBMC in vitro.
