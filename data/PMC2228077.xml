We performed a study with GI147211, a new semisynthetic camptothecin analogue, to determine the absolute bioavailability of the drug given orally. Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumour refractory to standard forms of therapy were eligible for the study. GI147211 was given orally on day 1 and as a 30-min infusion daily on days 2-5. The treatment course was repeated every 3 weeks. In subsequent patient cohorts, the dose of the oral formulation was escalated from 1.5 mg m(-2) to 6.0 mg m(-2); the dose for i.v. administration was fixed at 1.2 mg m(-2). Plasma pharmacokinetics was performed on day 1 and 2 of the first course and on day 1 of the second course using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. Nineteen patients were entered into the study; one patient was not evaluable because the treatment course was stopped prematurely. Eighteen patients received a total of 47 treatment courses. The absolute bioavailability of GI147211 averaged 1.3 +/- 5.2%. Drug appeared quickly in plasma with a median Tmax at 0.5 h. Fasting or fed state had no significant influence on the bioavailability of GI147211. The terminal half-life after administration of oral GI147211 was 6.85 +/- 3.13 h, similar to the half-life after intravenous administration. The major toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Nadirs for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred on day 8 and day 15 respectively. Other toxicities predominantly consisted of mild and infrequent nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. The oral administration of the drug is well tolerated. Oral administration of topoisomerase I inhibitor GI147211 results in a low bioavailability with relatively wide interpatient variation. The intravenous route of administration is advised for further development of this promising topoisomerase I inhibitor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="946" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="947" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="948" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="949" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="950" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00171-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="951" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
