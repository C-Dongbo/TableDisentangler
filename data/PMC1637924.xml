Since the conduct of the first randomized controlled clinical trial in cancer patients in the mid-1950's, substantial progress has been made in the utilization of the clinical trial technique for the evaluation of therapeutic efficiacy. The important elements of a protocol are given with some discussion of items to be considered in designing a protocol. The types of clinical trial (phase I, II, III) are defined, and the place of each phase of study in the context of the search for new treatments is delineated. A comprehensive discussion is given of the elements in the comparative clinical trial (phase III), including objectives, consierations in planning (comparability of treatment groups stratification of patients, feasibility and size of study, and prospective versus retrospective studies). Brief descriptions are given of designs for comparative clinical trials and a trial in oat cell lung carcinoma is discussed in some detail. Finally, some comments and references are given concerning the analysis of clinical trials.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="31" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="32" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="33" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="34" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="35" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="36" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="37" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="38" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="39" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="40" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="41" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="42" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="43" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="44" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="45" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="46" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="47" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00477-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="48" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
