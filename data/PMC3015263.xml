Conventional dieting and exercise failed to maintain weight loss in all patients. Hormonal assays were performed to exclude endocrine disturbances in suspected cases. All patients were assessed by a psychiatrist and only those approved were offered the procedure. Patients were informed about the nature and the hazards of the procedure. They were told about the postoperative course and the need for regular follow up.</p><p>All procedures were performed by the same team. The operative layout is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref></bold>. The patient is positioned in a head-up position. The procedure was performed through a 5-trocar technique (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold>). A sixth trocar was used in two patients for traction of enormous greater omentum.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Operative Layout.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-2-1-57-g01"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The port sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-2-1-57-g02"/></fig><p>The procedure involves gastric partitioning with an inflatable gastric band (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). The band is primarily inserted empty to avoid excessive narrowing of the stoma. Prior to dissection, the proximal gastric pouch is sized 15 ml by a special calibrating tube. A window is opened in the lesser omentum and the retro-gastric space is dissected to accommodate the band. Before closure of the band, the stoma size is adjusted by an electronic device attached to the calibrating tube. The band is fixed in place by a series of inverting non-absorbable sutures. At the completion of the procedure, a specially designed reservoir is inserted deep to the left anterior rectus sheath. Drainage is not needed in this operation. Two patients had symptomatic gallstones, and cholecystectomy was successfully performed immediately after band insertion. Patients were allowed oral fluids at the night of the operation and were discharged shortly after the procedure. Weight loss is assessed at monthly intervals for six months and then bimonthly for the same period. At the first visit, a gastric series was performed to assess the size of the stoma and the size of the proximal gastric pouch (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref></bold>). If necessary, the stoma is adjusted by injection (or withdrawal) of saline from the reservoir by a special non-coring needle, under fluoroscopic control. Injection is done as an outpatient procedure. Injection of 0.4 ml saline narrows the stoma by 0.5 mm, approximately. Injection is indicated when the patient can swallow his regular meal at frequent intervals or if the weight loss is inadequate on repeated visits.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The band with it's reservoir.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-2-1-57-g03"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The band applied around the fundus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-2-1-57-g04"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The proximal pouch in a gastric study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jsls-2-1-57-g05"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 31.3 years (range 16-49). The mean BMI was 44.2 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All procedures were completed laparoscopically. The conversion rate is 0%. The mean operative time was 152 minutes (range 75-300). Two patients had a small hiatus hernia which made the band insertion more difficult but still successful. The morbidity rate was 15.32% (6/39) and there was no mortality in this series.</p><p>Thirty-three patients needed band adjustment over the follow-up period. There were 52 injections and only one deflation done. Nineteen patients needed inflation only once, while in nine patients inflation was done twice. In the remaining five patients, the band was injected with saline three times. One patient from this last group needed deflation when she suffered from repeated vomiting after the last injection. A gastric series confirmed the tight stoma and showed the improvement after deflation of the band. Vomiting rapidly disappeared afterwards.</p><p>The mean hospital stay was 2.7 days (range 2-7). <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold> shows the early and late complications encountered in this series.

Yet, these measures are unable to sustain weight loss in morbidly obese patients. On the other hand, surgery has proven to be a successful long-term remedy for morbidly obese and superobese patients.</p><p>Vertical banded gastroplasty is considered by many as the favorable procedure for weight reduction. It does have its side effects. An obvious disadvantage is that it entails gastric stapling and cutting and hence is not completely reversible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup></p><p>The introduction of the silicone gastric band by Kuzmac in 1983 was warmly received by many of those involved in obesity surgery. The reported morbidity, mortality and efficacy compares well to vertical banded gastroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> It has the advantage of simplicity as it creates a small gastric pouch and a narrow stoma in one step. Following the successful use of laparoscopy in many surgical procedures, a few reports showed successful use of laparoscopy in inserting the band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> and in performing vertical banded gastroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, laparoscopic insertion was successful in all attempted patients. The presence of a small sliding hiatus hernia is not a contraindication, but it adds to the difficulty of the procedure. The patients stayed in the hospital for a short mean period of 2.7 days. The cosmetic appearance of postoperative scars was excellent in all patients. Patients started to lose weight rapidly.</p><p>Many of the problems in vertical banded gastroplasty is stoma-related.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> In our study, adjustment of the size of the stoma is easily done as an outpatient procedure. The number of injections needed varies in different patients and it should be individualized. One should not hesitate to deflate the band if the patient starts to suffer from repeated vomiting.</p><p>The laparoscopic approach yields results that are comparable to the open approach for insertion of the adjustable gastric band.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> The morbidity rate is lesser, particularly respiratory and wound complications. The cosmetic result is far better than the open approach. Patients return to their full activity earlier. Though the number of patients in this series is small, and the follow-up period is short, we believe, guided by our early results, that the laparoscopic insertion of the gastric band should be the routine way of insertion. The procedure needs fine laparoscopic skills and is best suited for the experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Patients seem to enjoy all the benefits of laparoscopic surgery. Proper patient selection is essential as regular follow-up is needed. Despite the potential risk of cholecystitis after weight reduction, we do not feel that prophylactic cholecystectomy should be routinely performed in these patients as it adds to the length and risks of an already demanding procedure. Moreover, the port sites are not optimally placed for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our policy is to remove only symptomatic gallstones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Adjustable gastric banding is a recognized successful mean for weight reduction. It is completely reversible as it does not entail gastric stapling, cutting or bypass. In a single step it creates a small gastric pouch and a new &#x0201c;controllable&#x0201d; stoma. Its application through the laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe. It adds to its advantages and deserves to be the standard technique.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
