There were 14 patients with upper limb type and 11 with lower limb type. 18 patients had unilateral involvement and 7 had bilateral involvement asymmetrically. The characteristics clinical features were sporadic occurrence, predominance in young males, nonprogressive course or initial progression for 1 to 3 years followed by stationary state, segmental distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy localized to one limb or both homologous limbs markedly asymmetrically, and absence of any definite sensory loss or central nervous system involvement. The electrophysiological, radiological, and muscle histopathological findings suggested chronic focal anterior horn cell disease. Although the prevalence of this disease is still unknown, the importance of recognition is being emphasized because of its common occurrence in our country and the benign prognosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
