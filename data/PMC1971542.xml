A total of 67% of patients entered remission using these drugs. An anthracycline was added for those patients not in remission. The overall remission rate (CR) was 86.5% (45/52), with a minimum follow-up of 90 days. Patients are hospitalised for relatively short periods, and consequently require less blood product and antibiotic support. Patients in continuing first remission following induction with Ara-C and etoposide are similar in number to those in continuing first remission who initially received an anthracycline. This would imply that the efficiency of Ara-C and etoposide in inducing long-term disease-term survival is comparable with anthracycline-containing regimens. We conclude that high-dose Ara-C and etoposide used in the first induction cycle for treating AML have good antileukaemic effect with acceptable toxicity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="830" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="831" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="832" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00219-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="833" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
