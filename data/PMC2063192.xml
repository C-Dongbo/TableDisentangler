Thirty patients (median age 61, range 45-72) were treated with docetaxel 100 mg m(-2) administered as a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks. Of 29 evaluable patients, four achieved a complete response and five a partial response, for an overall response rate of 31%. The median duration of response was 6 months (range 4-51+). A total of 104 cycles were administered. The median number of cycles given was three (range 1-9). Toxic effects of docetaxel mainly consisted of neutropenia, which, however, rarely caused infectious complications (5%). Fluid retention or neuropathy necessitated treatment cessation in two patients. We conclude that docetaxel is an effective agent in urothelial cell cancer, and should be further tested in combination chemotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00014-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1342" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00014-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1343" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00014-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1344" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00014-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1345" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
