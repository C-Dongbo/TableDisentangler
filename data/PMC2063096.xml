Data on all patients with small bowel malignancy who were seen at a single institution over a 5-year period were retrieved from the gastrointestinal unit and hospital databases, and these cases were reviewed. Eight patients with advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma received PVI 5FU-based chemotherapy. The overall response rate in assessable patients was 37.5% (3/8). The median overall survival was 13 months (range 1-28), and progression-free survival was 7.8 months (range 0-15). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated and symptomatic benefit was seen. In conclusion, PVI 5-FU has activity in this disease. This should be assessed either as a single agent or as part of a combination regimen such as epirubicin/cisplatin/PVI FU (ECF) in a multicentre randomized study.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="508" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="509" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="510" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
