In all but one patient, mobilisation was successful, requiring three or fewer leucocytopheresis sessions in 26 patients; 28 patients subsequently underwent high-dose chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin 1600 mg m-2, thiotepa 480 mg m-2 and cyclophosphamide 6 g m-2 (CTC) followed by PBSC transplantation. Haemopoietic engraftment was rapid with a median time to neutrophils of 500 x 10(6) l(-1) of 9 days (range 8-10) in patients who received G-CSF after PBSC-transplantation; platelet transfusion independence was reached within a median of 10 days (range 7-16). Neutropenic fever occurred in 96% of patients. Gastrointestinal toxicity was substantial but reversible. Renal, neural or ototoxicity was not observed. Complications related to the central venous catheter were encountered in 64% of patients, with major vein thrombosis occurring in 18%. High-dose CTC-chemotherapy with PBSC-transplantation, harvested after mobilisation with FEC and G-CSF, is reasonably well tolerated without life-threatening toxicity and is a suitable high-dose strategy for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="857" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="858" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="859" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="860" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="861" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="862" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
