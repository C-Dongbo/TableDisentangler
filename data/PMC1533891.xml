exerts both beneficial and harmful effects on
human beings.  Positive health effects of UV are not only
connected with general well-being and vitamin D production but are also used
in the treatment of certain autoimmune and allergic diseases. UV
exposure initiates a complex cascade of responses, which finally
results in down-regulation of the immune system. Deleterious
effects of UV exposure include erythema, burns, photoaging, DNA
damage, carcinogenesis, and impaired resistance to bacterial,
viral, parasitic and fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As various immune  mediators 
(eg, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, prostaglandin <italic>E</italic><sub>2</sub>) were found to be secreted by UV-irradiated 
keratinocytes and some were also found in the serum of UV-irradiated mice 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; 
therefore it is likely that any alteration in the skin immune system may have an impact on the systemic immunological response.</p><p>Under normal or pathological conditions, cytokines, circulating
and released under various stimuli, can modulate cells'
activities. They also take part in various biological phenomena
such as inflammatory response, acute-phase reaction, and wound
healing. One of the most important cytokines is TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, secreted under various stimuli such as infections and acute ultraviolet irradiation. This cytokine shows many biological activities, for example, enhances phagocytosis and
cytotoxicity and modulates expression of proteins such as IL-1 and
IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two isoforms of IL-1 (IL-1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-1 <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) are important mediators of inflammatory reactions, promoting adhesion of neutrophils, monocytes, and T and B cells.
This cytokine also influences Langerhans cells function and is
involved in the cutaneous response to UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. IL-6 is a potent cytokine with various biologic activities including
induction of fever and acute-phase response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is also the most important mediator of systemic sunburn reaction. Its
synthesis is enhanced by inflammatory stimuli such as microbes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interleukin-8 is one of the proinflammatory chemokines which mobilizes and activates neutrophils, lymphocytes T, NK
cells, and basophils. It presents chemotactic abilities for
migratory immune cells and is a mitogen for epidermal cells. IL-10
is known to be important for systemic and local
photoimmunosuppression. Some studies revealed its increased
concentration in serum of UV-irradiated mice, while treatment with
anti-IL-10 antibodies protected mice against UV-mediated
immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Most studies regarding the influence of UVR on levels of
inflammatory cytokines were conducted mainly in cultures of human
keratinocytes or in laboratory animals. Few studies were also
performed in human subjects; however the groups were small and in
most cases only single, high doses of UVR were used.</p><p>Thus, the aim of our study was to compare serum concentration of
 IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and
TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in human healthy volunteers before and after
exposure to different schedules and sources of UV irradiation, mainly low, chronic
doses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>The study included 105 healthy volunteers, aged between 18 and 55

and February 2004. Each volunteer gave written informed consent
before entering the study and all the experiments were approved by
the local Ethics Committee. The investigations were carried out in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Before entering the
study the subjects underwent thorough physical examination, blood

Angeles, Calif) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Barcode-labeled units contained one bead with a murine-specific
monoclonal antibody in which alkaline phosphatase (conjugated to a
specific rabbit polyclonal antibody) was an enzyme for
chemiluminescence reaction. These IMMULITE kit components were
required for immunochemiluminescence assay measurements by the
IMMULITE 1000 analyzer. After 30 or 60  minutes of incubation of
antigen with a specific antibody, chemiluminescence substrate was
hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase and then a beam of photons was
released. Intensity of chemiluminescence reaction was measured by
a luminometer and it was in line with the concentration of
determined cytokine. Moreover for  each cytokine measurement
IMMULITE cytokine control module was performed.</p><p>Sensitivity and reference ranges for IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, IL-8,

(105/105) volunteers, both before and after UVB or SSR
irradiation.</p><p>IL-6 was detectable in 17 out of 105 individuals before
irradiation and its concentration increased slightly after UV
exposure (in each assessed group). However, no statistical
correlation between UV exposure and IL-6 level was found.</p><p>IL-8 levels were detectable before irradiation in 29 out of 105
volunteers. We found a statistically significant increase
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) in IL-8 serum level after 10 days of UVB irradiation in
Groups A and B (mean values raised from 5.34 to 6.04&#x02009;pg/mL and
from 5.65 to 6.22&#x02009;pg/mL, resp). Local acute UVB irradiation
which was additionally applied in Group B did not cause any
significant changes in this cytokine level.</p><p>No changes in IL-8 level were observed in Group D in which only
local acute dose of UVB was applied. In contrast to chronic low
doses of UVB, repeated for 10 days, irradiation with SSR (Group
C) did not lead to any alterations in IL-8 serum concentration.</p><p>In Group B IL-10 was over reference range (0&#x02013;9.1&#x02009;pg/mL)
before UVB irradiation (15.5&#x02009;pg/mL) only in one volunteer but
its level was much higher after 10-day UVB exposure
(29.8&#x02009;pg/mL) and undetectable after the additional 3 MED
irradiation. The same tendency was observed in Group A.
Also in one individual before irradiation the level was 12.0&#x02009;pg/mL and, after 10 days of repeated exposure, &#x02212;14.5&#x02009;pg/mL. In Group C two subjects had
elevated IL-10 levels before irradiation; however 10-day SSR
exposure did not cause any increase in the interleukin level. In
Group D no effect of an acute single dose of UVB on serum level of
this cytokine was observed.</p><p>Before irradiation TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> serum level was detected
in 90 out of 105 volunteers (86%). In 76 out of 90 its
concentration was within reference ranges and only in 14 cases it
was over the expected values (8.2&#x02013;24.3&#x02009;pg/mL). In Groups A
and B a slight, statistically significant, increase in serum level
was observed after 10 days of irradiation (for both comparisons
<italic>P</italic> = .05, resp).</p><p>Local acute UVB doses and repeated SSR irradiation did not change
the concentration of this cytokine further.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first one in which serum
concentrations of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and
TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> were examined in human healthy volunteers
exposed to repeated suberythemal UVB and/or SSR doses. We
investigated also SSR, as human beings are usually exposed to
chronic and low solar UVR not only UVB. We also wanted to find out
whether chronic irradiation might result in an adaptive effect.
For this purpose in two groups of volunteers (B and C) chronic
irradiation was followed by a single, acute local UVB exposure.
Groups A and D were the controls for this hypothesis.</p><p>In our study IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> serum levels were undetectable in all
volunteers both before and after UVB and/or SSR
irradiation. Literature data showed that both whole-body and local
UV irradiation of human subjects increase IL-1 and IL-6 levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Granstein and Sauder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed that IL-1 serum level increased after whole-body 1 MED UV irradiation. The highest concentration of IL-1 was observed between 1 to
4&#x02009;hours after exposure and it returned to baseline within
8&#x02009;hours after exposure. In our study significantly lower doses
of UV were used and blood samples were taken 24&#x02009;hours after UV
exposure. This may explain why we observed no alteration in
IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> serum level in the volunteers and shows that
such effects may be rather transient.</p><p>In our volunteers IL-6 was detectable only in 17 out of 105
individuals before irradiation. After irradiation we observed a
slight increase in its level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>); however it
was within normal ranges and the differences were not
statistically significant. No correlation between UV exposure and
IL-6 level could be found. Urbanski et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] examined the serum level of IL-6 in human subjects irradiated with UV dose
causing severe sunburn reaction (4 MED, single whole-body
irradiation). They showed a significant increase in this cytokine
level 12&#x02009;hours after UV irradiation. We used low UV doses and
in all cases serum concentration was measured 24&#x02009;hours after
irradiation which probably resulted in the obtained results, again
supporting the notice of effects being transient.</p><p>Literature data revealed that irradiation of cultured human
corneal stroma cells and whole human corneas with acute UVR doses
induced a significant increase of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in both corneal stroma cells and whole human
corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We detected IL-8 before irradiation in 29 out of 105 volunteers. Only in volunteers exposed to 10-day
irradiation with 0.7 MED of UVB (Groups A and B) we found
statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) differences in IL-8 level
before and after irradiation. In Group B, IL-8 level decreased
after additional irradiation with a dose of 3 MED which could
suggest that exposure to repeated UVB irradiation causes
adaptation to the effects of higher UV doses. However, in Group D,
an acute dose of UVB, 3 MED regarded as an immunosuppressive one
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], applied locally on a small area, caused no alteration in IL-8 level. Thus, we conclude that acute local doses of UVB do
not influence IL-8 serum concentrations. It was revealed that UVB
radiation induced an increase in IL-8 mRNA expression in normal
cultured human epidermal keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Kondo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] also showed a significant elevation in IL-8 level 24&#x02009;hours after exposure to UVB (100&#x02013;300&#x02009;J/m<sup>2</sup>) in supernatants of cultured keratinocytes.</p><p>No significant alterations in IL-10 were found in our study, and
its cytokine level was detected before irradiation only in single
subjects. After UVB or SSR irradiation, an increase in those cases
was observed; however in none it exceeded normal ranges. A small
number of cases observed do not allow us to draw any conclusion
and we may suppose that this tendency was coincidental. It was
revealed that UVB also increased the production of IL-10 in the
epidermis, mainly due to influx of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, in supernatants of UVB-irradiated human keratinocytes, IL-10 was
not detected when ELISA assay was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Barr et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] observed a slight increase in IL-10 level in suction blisters after exposure to 3 MED of SSR and concluded that
this dose is the threshold one for local induction rather than systemic alteration of this cytokine.</p><p>TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> serum level was detected in most volunteers
(90 out of 105) before irradiation. Similarly to the results
obtained on IL-8 level, a modest increase after 10-day irradiation
was observed, but additional UV exposure failed to influence the
concentration any further. Neither local acute UVB doses nor
repeated SSR irradiation for 10 days changed this cytokine serum
concentration. It is worth mentioning that TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>
as a proinflammatory cytokine, was detected in 86% of the
examined volunteers; however in the majority of them its
concentration was within reference ranges. K&#x000f6;ck et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] revealed that exposure of human carcinoma cell line cells and
normal human keratinocytes to UVB at a dose of 100&#x02009;J/m<sup>2</sup>
caused an increase in the expression of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> mRNA
with a maximum production 12&#x02009;hours after irradiation. Exposure
of human skin to solar-simulated radiation (SSR) in a dose of 3
MED resulted in 8-fold TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> increase in suction
blisters 15&#x02009;hours after irradiation then rapidly
declined to control values. The same authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]
revealed that single whole-body exposure to UVB (4 MED) caused an
increase in serum TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level 12 and 24&#x02009;hours
after irradiation. Exposure of human skin to solar-simulated
radiation (SSR) in a dose of 3 MED resulted in TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> increase in suction blisters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]</p><p>In our study no alterations in cytokine levels in serum, apart
from IL-8 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, were found. These results are
in line with those obtained by McLoone et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In other studies, release of cytokines into circulation was caused by
higher, strongly erythemogenic doses of UVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].
Until now not much was known about the influence of suberythemal
doses of UVB and/or SSR irradiation on serum profile of selected
cytokines, nor had we any information whether local irradiation
with acute UVB doses could influence these parameters. Our results
indicate the necessity of further investigation to determine the
threshold for different sources and different outputs of UV which
could cause impairment of systemic immunity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was funded by the European Union research project
