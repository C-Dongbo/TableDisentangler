Pretreatment ATase levels ranged from approximately 70 to 600 fmol per mg of protein. Depletion of PMC ATase was seen within 4 h of the first dose of temozolomide and had a median nadir of 52.9% and values ranging from 44.4% to 71.0% of pretreatment levels. There was a correlation between the extent of ATase depletion (pretreatment minus nadir level) and the pretreatment ATase level (r = 0.97). A progressive depletion of ATase was observed during the 5 days of continuous temozolomide therapy with median ATase activities of 66.3%, 52.5%, 39.5%, 30.5% and 28.9% of the pretreatment values at days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. This suggests that the schedule-dependent anti-tumour activity of temozolomide seen in experimental models and clinics may be related to a cumulative depletion of ATase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="452" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="453" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="454" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="455" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="456" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
