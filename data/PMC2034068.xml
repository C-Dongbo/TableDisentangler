Twenty-one patients with stage IIIB and IV NSCLC were treated in a single-centre study with escalating doses of epirubicin and vinorelbine given on an outpatient basis. The first dose level comprised epirubicin 100 mg m-2 on day 1 and vinorelbine 20 mg m-2 (days 1 and 8) given intravenously every 3 weeks. Escalating doses for epirubicin and vinorelbine were respectively 120 (day 1) and 20 (days 1 and 8), 120 (day 1) and 25 (days 1 and 8) and 135 (day 1) and 25 (days 1 and 8) mg m-2. Inclusion criteria were age &#x0003c; or = 75 years, ECOG performance score &#x0003c; or = 2 and normal renal, hepatic and bone marrow functions. Dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia grade II and neutropenia grade III on day 8, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenia lasting &#x0003e; 7 days. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed at the first dose level; at the 135/25 mg m-2 dose level three out of six patients had a DLT which was considered as unacceptable. The only non-haematological toxicity reaching grade III was nausea/vomiting. One patient showed cardiac toxicity. No neurotoxicity and no treatment-related deaths were seen. The maximum tolerated dose of epirubicin and vinorelbine is 135 mg m-2 (day 1) and 25 mg m-2 (days 1 and 8) respectively, causing mainly haematological toxicity. The recommended dose of epirubicin and vinorelbine for phase II studies is found to be 120 mg m-2 and 20 mg m-2 respectively.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1547" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1548" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1549" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00046-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1550" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
