Ten patients received two bolus doses of cyclophosphamide (maximum tolerated total dose 10 G m-2), ifosfamide as a 24 h infusion (11 G m-2) followed by mitomycin C (70 mg m-2) as a subsequent 24 h infusion and mustine as two boluses (total dose 30 mg m-2). Another 13 patients received the same agents except cisplatin was substituted for cyclophosphamide, two doses (total dose 100 mg m-2) being given in a 24 h period. The median time of recovery to greater than or equal to 20,000 platelets was 21 days and of neutropaenia greater than or equal to 500 was 12-15 days. Unusual non-haematological toxicity e.g. cardiomyopathy, colitis, veno occlusive disease was not noted, all patients being given regular selenium and other trace elements. Three patients died in the first 2 weeks. There were five complete responses (22%) and 12 partial responses (52%) with four patients (2CR, 2PR) still alive at 27, 48, 73 and 82 weeks. The patient's Karnofsky performance in the cisplatin regimen improved over pretreatment values when compared a month after the end of treatment. The high dose regimen was associated with a high (74%) response rate, but with an overall median survival of only 6 months. The regimen has no advantage over conventional doses with the same agents in patients with metastatic NSCLC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00210-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="293" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00210-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="294" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00210-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="295" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00210-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="296" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00210-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="297" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
