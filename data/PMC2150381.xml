However, because such cases received chemotherapy that alone frequently causes pulmonary toxicity, the role of G-CSF in this toxicity has been unclear. CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) only slightly induces pulmonary toxicity. However, we observed a considerable incidence of this toxicity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma subjects receiving CHOP therapy and G-CSF (6 out of 52 subjects, 11.5%). In this cohort, among various characteristics, including the dose and interval of CHOP therapy, only the mean peak leucocyte count (MPLC) with each therapy cycle was associated with development of this toxicity (MPLC &#x0003e; or = 23.0 x 10(9) l(-1), 6 out of 29 cases; MPLC &#x0003c; 23.0 x 10(9) l(-1), 0 out of 23 cases; P = 0.020). These findings suggest that the effect of G-CSF is the main determinant of the pulmonary toxicity in these cases. Because the toxicity was associated with a large MPLC and did not recur in cases readministered G-CSF, an idiosyncratic reaction to G-CSF is unlikely to be the pathogenesis of this toxicity. Thus, lowering the G-CSF dose seems to be useful in the prevention of this toxicity. In all six cases, the time course of manifestation of the toxicity was the same, and early application of high-dose corticosteroid led to cure. This knowledge will be helpful in the care of similar cases.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0233-a" xlink:role="2287"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2286" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2287" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2288" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2289" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2290" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
