This is particularly so for cancer patients, whose life expectancy may be short. Patients with advanced colorectal cancer who participated in two international comparative studies of raltitrexed ('Tomudex') vs standard 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin (LV) completed previously validated quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC questionnaire, EuroQol and Rotterdam Symptom Check List) at various times during the studies. Early statistically significant advantages of raltitrexed vs 5-FU plus LV on quality of life were observed at week 2 in five of eight of the EuroQol and three of four of the Rotterdam Symptom Check List dimensions. Such advantages were not observed using the EORTC questionnaire, which was not completed until week 12. The necessary dose delays and different dose schedules made it difficult in these studies to compare the impact on quality of life of the two treatments. It may be that performance status, effect on disease-related symptoms and the incidence of toxicity are the most important indications of a patient's quality of life.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="12" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="13" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00090-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="14" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
