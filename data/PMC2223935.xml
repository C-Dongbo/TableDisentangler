A response rate of 62% in 45 patients has been reported for treatment with dacarbazine, bleomycin, vincristine, lomustine (BOLD) plus interferon alpha (IFN-alpha). We conducted a multicentre phase II study to confirm these results. Melanoma patients with distant metastases were treated as outpatients with dacarbazine 200 mg m(-2) on days 1-5, vincristine 1 mg m(-2) on days 1 and 4, bleomycin 15 mg on days 2 and 5 i.v. and lomustine 80 mg orally on day 1, repeated every 4 weeks. IFN-alpha-2b was initiated s.c. on day 8 at 3 MU daily for 6 weeks, and 6 MU t.i.w. thereafter. Forty-three patients entered the study. The median number of metastatic sites was three (range 1-5), and 81% of patients had visceral metastases. Nine patients had brain metastases, and seven patients were systemically pretreated. Among the 41 patients that were evaluable for response, the response rate was 27% (95% CI 14-3%), with one complete and ten partial remissions. The response rate in 25 previously untreated patients without brain metastases was 40% (95% CI 21-61%). Median duration of response was 6 (range 2-14+) months; median overall survival was 5 (1-26) months. The main toxicity was malaise/fatigue. We confirm that BOLD plus IFN-alpha has activity in metastatic melanoma. The lower response rate in our study compared with the previous report is probably related to patient selection, as in the previous study 46% of patients had stage III disease, whereas all our patients had stage IV disease, which is associated with a worse prognosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="266" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="267" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="268" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="269" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
