		<p>A comparison of 60 blood transfused and 71 nonblood transfused hepatic resection patients was
done to evaluate strategies for reducing blood transfusions during hepatic surgery. There were no
significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative laboratory data,
except for prothrombin time and hematocrit value. The mean operative blood loss was 1990 ml
and 760 ml in the blood transfused and nonblood transfused groups, respectively. A multivariate
analysis suggested that the patient&#x02019;s body weight, preoperative prothrombin time, and operative
blood loss independently predicted the need for intraoperative blood transfusion. Major
postoperative complications developed more frequently in the blood transfused group than in
the nonblood transfused group (31.7 vs. 11.3%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.005). These results suggest that the
difference in operative blood loss between the two groups was related to the prolonged
prothrombin time and a susceptibility for blood transfusion was found to exist particularly in
patients with a lower hematocrit value as well as a lower body weight. Thus, the improvement of
these preoperative laboratory data combined with avoiding the use of the hematocrit value as
a determining factor for intraoperative transfusion could correspond to a reduction in operative
blood loss, while curtailing the demands on blood bank facilities, and lowering the risk of
postoperative complications.</p>
