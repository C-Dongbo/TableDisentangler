The total response rate was 32% (95% confidence interval 24-40%); 13% had a complete remission. Female patients had a significantly higher chance of response than male patients: 46% vs 23%. There was also a difference in complete response rate: 25% vs 9%. The overall survival was 6 months; 8% of patients had a response of more than 6 months and 2% of more than 2 years. Although response rates vary among the various regimens described in the literature, the complete response rates are quite similar and the long-term disease-free survival of these combinations may be similar to that of dacarbazine alone.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="681" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="682" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00056-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="683" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
