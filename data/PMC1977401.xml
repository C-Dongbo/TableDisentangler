Because the clinical and immunological effects of prolonged continuous exposure to rIL-2 are unknown, we have conducted a phase I study to assess the toxicity and feasibility of continuous low dose infusion of rIL-2 (EuroCetus) using central venous access with a portable infusion device on an out-patient basis. Twenty-two patients entered the study, 13 with melanoma and nine with renal cell cancer, age range 26-66 years (median 51), performance status less than or equal to 1. They were treated with one of the following doses per m2 per 24 h: 0.18 x 10(6) IU, 0.6 x 10(6) IU, 1.8 x 10(6) IU, 3 x 10(6) IU, 6 x 10(6) IU and 9 x 10(6) IU. Toxicity was evaluable in 20 patients receiving greater than or equal to 3 weeks treatment duration or in whom treatment was discontinued prematurely because of toxicity. Constitutional symptoms consisting of fatigue, malaise and fever up to 40 degrees C without significant organ dysfunction occurred with doses greater than or equal to 1.8 x 10(6) IU m-2. The maximum tolerated dose was 6 x 10(6) IU m-2 24 h-1. In all patients toxicity reached a peak at 3 weeks and resolved thereafter despite continued rIL-2 treatment. Peripheral blood eosinophilia (up to 66% of white blood cell count) followed the same pattern. An infection of the central venous access occurred in 55% of the patients but this was mostly asymptomatic. Thirteen patients were treated greater than or equal to 6 weeks and were evaluable for tumour response. A partial remission occurred in a patient with melanoma with a dose of 1.8 x 10(6) IU rIL-2 m-2 24 h-1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="744" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="745" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="746" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="747" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="748" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="749" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0120.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="750" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
