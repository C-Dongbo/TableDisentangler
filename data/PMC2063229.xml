In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of Cath D was also performed on a subset of 86 tumours. Cath D levels were distributed in an asymmetrical way and were skewed towards the lower values (median value 20.8 pmol mg(-1) protein, range 2.0-99.0 pmol mg(-1) protein). No correlation was found between Cath D levels and clinicopathological parameters. However, the percentage of Cath D positivity was significantly higher in oestrogen receptor-positive (57%) compared with oestrogen receptor-negative (36%) cases (P= 0.01). The percentage of Cath D-positive staining was not significantly different for both epithelial (27%) and stromal components (40%). Immunoradiometrically detected Cath D levels were not different according to Cath D stromal immunostaining (P= 0.18), while higher Cath D levels were measured in Cath D-positive than in Cath D-negative tumour epithelial cells (P = 0.027). Survival analysis was conducted on 161 primary untreated ovarian cancer patients. The 5-year overall survival rate was 57% and 55% in Cath D-positive and Cath D-negative patients respectively (P = 0.69). As far as time to progression was concerned, there was no significant difference in the survival rate of patients with either high or low Cath D content (P = 0.56). Similar results have been obtained in the subset of patients in which Cath D was analysed by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, Cath D measurement in tumour extracts appears to have a limited usefulness in improving the prognostic characterization of ovarian cancer patients.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0113-a" xlink:role="1649"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1645" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1646" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1647" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1648" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1649" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1650" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1651" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00016-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1652" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
