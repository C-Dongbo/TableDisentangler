Nineteen patients were chemonaive and six were previously treated. The starting dose was 50 mg m-2 week-1. This dose could be escalated without major toxicity to 70 mg m-2 week-1. At a dose of 80 mg m-2 myelosuppression grade 3 occurred as well as grade 1 nephro- and neurotoxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was 85 mg m-2 with dose limiting thrombocytopenia. Hypertonic saline was effective in preventing nephrotoxicity. Ondansetron was a very effective antiemetic in the first weeks of treatment but its efficacy waned later on. Responses were observed in head and neck cancer, melanoma and mesothelioma. At the dose level of 80 mg m-2 the optimal dose intensity was reached. This schedule will be tested further in phase II studies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00200-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="789" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00200-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="790" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00200-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="791" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00200-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="792" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
