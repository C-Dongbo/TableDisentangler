The median age of patients was 64 years (range 39-84). The male-female ratio was 42:28 and 35 (50%) had metastatic disease. Fifty-seven patients were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 64.4%, including 14 (23.7%) complete responses and 24 (40.7%) partial responses. Median time to progression was 7 months in responders and 8 months in patients with limited disease. The median survival in patients with limited disease was 10.5 months (range 0.5-70 +) and 7 months (range 0.5-24) in those with extensive disease. Improvement of symptoms occurred in 79% of patients with shortness of breath, 80% with cough, 81% with haemoptysis and 68% with pain. In 19 patients an increase in body weight was noted. Major (WHO grade 3/4) toxicities were neutropenia in 13 (18.5%) patients, alopecia in 33 (47.1%) patients, mucositis in 15 (21.4%) patients, anorexia in eight patients (11.4%), nausea and vomiting in six patients (8.5%) and diarrhoea in 4 (5.7%) patients. In conclusion, EE is an active and well-tolerated outpatient regimen in the treatment of SCLC. The survival data in this unselected group of patients were disappointing and the possible explanations for this are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00169-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="639" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00169-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="640" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00169-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="641" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00169-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="642" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
