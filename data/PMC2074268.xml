Hence, information on drug concentration profiles in tumours is of critical importance but appropriate methods for measurement are lacking. The aim of the present study was to obtain, by microdialysis sampling, concentration--time profiles in a solid tumour (melanoma) of a model anti-cancer drug, carboplatin, and thereby to assess the scope of microdialysis for tumour pharmacokinetic studies in man. Six patients with cutaneous melanoma metastases at the extremities or body trunk, scheduled to receive carboplatin (400 mg m-2 i.v.) were studied. Carboplatin concentrations were monitored in serum, intratumoral and subcutaneous tissue. Calibration of the microdialysis probes was carried out in vitro and in vivo with use of the retrodialysis method. Complete carboplatin concentration vs time profiles in tumour and subcutaneous tissue were obtained. Major pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, area under the curve, elimination half-life) were calculated for tissues and tumour/serum concentration ratios for carboplatin were derived. Mean free concentrations of carboplatin in cutaneous melanoma metastases reached only about 50-60% of total serum levels; maximal intratumoral concentrations were 7.6 (+/-2.0; s.e.m.) microgram/ml, mean concentrations in subcutaneous tissue were similar to those in tumour. The present study demonstrates that microdialysis is a novel tool for measuring drug concentrations in solid tumours in humans in vivo and appears to be a valuable addition for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies in oncology.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0077-a" xlink:role="921"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="920" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="921" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="922" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="923" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00035-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="924" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
