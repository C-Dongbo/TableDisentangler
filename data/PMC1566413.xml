The neurobehavioral and emotional health effects of this exposure and subsequent evacuation are presented. Urine mercury levels were measured before (urine1) and 3-10 weeks after evacuation (urine2) of the building, when neurobehavioral and psychological measures were also completed. Performance on neurobehavioral and psychologic measures were compared between subjects above and below the median for urine1 (&#x0003e;=19 microg/g creatinine) and were correlated with urine1 mercury levels. The high urine mercury group made more errors on a test of fine motor function and 84% of the residents reported clinically significant elevations in somatic and psychologic symptoms. Although subclinical tremor from mercury exposure may have affected subtle hand-eye coordination, other tests of motor function were not affected. Therefore, the observation of reduced hand-eye coordination may be due to chance. Significant levels of psychosocial stress were more closely associated with the evacuation necessitated by mercury exposure rather than a direct effect of mercury exposure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00510-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="343" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00510-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="344" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00510-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="345" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00510-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="346" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00510-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="347" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
