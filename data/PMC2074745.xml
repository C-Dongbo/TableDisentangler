Seventy-three consecutive patients with unresectable or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic oesophagus were treated with cisplatin 80 mg m-2 by 4 h infusion on day 1, etoposide 100 mg (fixed dose) by 2 h infusion on day 1 and 2, and etoposide 200 mg m-2 orally on day 3 and 5. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks, for a maximum of six courses. The oral dosages of etoposide were modified individually until a significant degree of myelosuppression was reached. Of 65 evaluable patients, five complete responses (CRs) and 26 partial responses (PRs) were seen, for an overall response rate of 48% (95% confidence interval 35-60%). Median time to progression was 7 months (range 3-72 + months). There were two toxic deaths (neutropenic sepsis). The response rate equals that of other cisplatin-based regimens. Its toxicity profile allows addition of a third active drug such as 5-fluorouracil.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00022-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="980" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00022-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="981" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00022-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="982" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00022-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="983" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00022-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="984" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
