Bioavailability after oral dosing is approximately 75%. We performed a phase II study with oral piritrexim in non-chemotherapy pretreated patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Thirty-three patients were treated with 25 mg three times daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated weekly, with provision for dose escalation or reduction according to the toxicity observed. Of 29 evaluable patients, one patient achieved a complete response of 19+ weeks duration, and ten patients achieved a partial response with a median duration of 22 weeks (range 16-48), for a total response rate of 38%. Piritrexim was generally well tolerated, with myelosuppression as the major toxicity, that frequently required dose modification. We conclude that piritrexim appears to be an active agent in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer when administered as a 5-day, low-dose oral schedule. It would be attractive to investigate the combination of piritrexim and cisplatin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="388" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="389" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="390" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
