Hydrocortisone 20 milligrams twice daily was commenced with the second injection of goserelin. Objective tumour response was monitored by computerised tomography of the abdomen. There was no objective remission in disease sites. Serial measurements of serum tumour markers showed no reduction in serum CA 19-9 and CA 195 concentrations. The median duration of survival of all cases was 5 months. Administration of goserelin resulted in significant reductions in oestradiol, testosterone, androstenedione in males and reductions in FSH and LH in both males and females. The addition of hydrocortisone resulted in further reductions of androstenedione and testosterone levels in males. Thus goserelin showed no anti-tumour effect, but concentrations required for direct inhibitory effects may be higher than those required to produce effects on hormone suppression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="379" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="380" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="381" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="382" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
