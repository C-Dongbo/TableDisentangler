Treatment attempts to prolong survival but trials rarely demonstrate a statistically significant survival advantage: it has been argued that chemotherapy does not prolong survival. The correlation between response rates and survival has been examined by reviewing 79 comparisons between arms with unequal response rates in 50 published trials of chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. In 73% of comparisons the group with the higher response rate also demonstrated the longer median survival (P less than 0.001). Weighted linear regression showed a statistically significant relationship between relative response rates and survival (P less than 0.001). The number of patients in a comparison did not influence this relationship.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="615" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="616" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="617" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="618" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
