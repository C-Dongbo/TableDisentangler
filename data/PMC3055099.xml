Eligible patients who had undergone induction with vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD) should have adequate cardiac, pulmonary and renal function (creatinine &#x0003c;2 mg/dL). Melphalan at 200 mg/m2 was used as a conditioning regimen. Eighty patients were enrolled from 13 centers. The median age of the patients was 53 yr (range; 20 to 68 yr). The initial stage was IA/IIA/IIB/IIIA/IIIB in 3/8/1/54/14 patients, respectively. Beta2-microglobulin, CRP and LDH were increased in 74, 42 and 34% of the patients examined. Cytogenetic data were available in 30 patients, and 6 patients showed numeric or structural abnormalities. Two therapy-related mortalities occurred from infection. Among the 78 evaluable patients, CR/PR/MR/NC/PD were achieved in 48/26/2/1/1 patients, respectively. After a median follow-up of 30 months, the median overall and event-free survivals were 66 months (95% CI: 20-112) and 24 months (95% CI: 18-29), respectively. This study verifies the efficacy and feasibility of high dose melphalan therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
