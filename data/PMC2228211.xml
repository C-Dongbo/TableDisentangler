Twenty-five patients with an ECOG performance score &#x0003c; 2 were treated with infusional topotecan administered as a daily, continuous intravenous infusion starting at 0.6 mg m(-2) day(-1) (NSCLC) and 0.5 mg m(-2) day(-1) (breast cancer) for 21 days every 4 weeks. Three patients achieved a partial response as defined by WHO criteria: one with NSCLC (8%; 95% CI 0-39%) and two with advanced breast cancer (15%; 95% CI 2-45%). The major toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with one episode of neutropenic sepsis. These data suggest that topotecan delivered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 21 days as single-agent therapy does not appear to offer a clinical advantage over conventional 5-day schedules against advanced NSCLC and advanced breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00176-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1636" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00176-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1637" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00176-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1638" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00176-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1639" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
