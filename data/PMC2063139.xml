Sixty-three patients with malignancy were enrolled into this non-randomized sequential study. The majority (55/63, 87%) had received at least two prior regimens of chemotherapy, and seven patients had previously failed to mobilize following high-dose cyclophosphamide with G-CSF. Consecutive patient groups received etoposide at three dose levels [2.0 g m(-2) (n = 22), 1.8 g m(-2) (n = 20) and 1.6 g m(-2) (n = 21)] followed by daily G-CSF. Subsequent leukaphereses were assayed for CD34+ cell content, with a target total collection of 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells kg(-1). Toxicity was assessed by the development of significant mucositis, the requirement for parenteral antibiotics or blood component support and rehospitalization incidence. Ten patients (16%) had less than the minimum target yield collected. Median collections in the three groups were 4.7 (2 g m(-2)), 5.7 (1.8 g m(-2)) and 6.5 (1.6 g m(-2)) x 10(6) CD34+ cells kg(-1). Five of the seven patients who had previously failed cyclophosphamide mobilization achieved more than the target yield. Rehospitalization incidence was significantly lower in patients receiving 1.6 g m(-2) etoposide than in those receiving 2.0 g m(-2) (P = 0.03). These data suggest that high-dose etoposide with G-CSF is an efficient mobilization regimen in the majority of heavily pretreated patients, including those who have previously failed on high-dose cyclophosphamide with G-CSF. An etoposide dose of 1.6 g m(-2) appears to be as effective as higher doses but less toxic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="928" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="929" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="930" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="931" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="932" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
