Nineteen patients with inoperable and/or metastatic gastric cancer, which was histologically proven, were orally administered 5'-DFUR 1,200 mg/m2 on days 1 to 4 and days 15-18 combined with 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin being repeated every 4 weeks. Five partial responses (PRs) were achieved. Seven patients had stable disease and 6 progressed on therapy. The overall response rate was 27.7% (95% confidence interval: 9.69% to 53.5%). The median survival duration of all 18 patients was 25 weeks (9-64). The majority of patients had WHO grade I/II toxicity, but there was no treatment-related death. These data support that the combinations of oral 5'-DFUR and cisplatin are well tolerable and have a moderate activity with low toxicity in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
