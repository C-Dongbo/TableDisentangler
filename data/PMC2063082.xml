However, only limited data are available on the combination of paclitaxel with other cytotoxic drugs in this entity. Patients with unresectable stage III, recurrent or metastatic tumours were treated in a multicentre setting with paclitaxel 90 mg m(-2) given over 3 h intravenously, followed by cisplatin 50 mg m(-2). The courses were repeated every 14 days. Twenty patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus were evaluable for response. The overall remission rate was 40% (8/20), including 15% (3/20) clinically complete responses. Clinical benefit response, defined as relief of dysphagia and/or significant gain in weight, was achieved in 70% of the patients. Neutropenia of CTC grade 3 occurred only in 10% of the patients; no grade 4 neutropenia and no severe thrombocytopenia was encountered. CTC grade 4 neurotoxicity was seen in 5% of patients. Cisplatin/paclitaxel administered every 14 days, was effective in patients with poor prognosis oesophageal cancer and toxicity was acceptable.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="511" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="512" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="513" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="514" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
