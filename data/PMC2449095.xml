Forty patients (80%) achieved an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse and after a mean follow-up period of 5.9 months, 32 patients were continuing to use treatment successfully. The average dose was 14 micrograms (range 2.5 to 30 micrograms). There were no cases of priapism or cavernosal fibrosis and no systemic side effects. A low incidence (8%) of local discomfort was reported. We conclude that prostaglandin is a safe and effective vasoactive agent for the treatment of erectile failure in a genito-urinary outpatient clinic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00069-0023.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="18" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00069-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="19" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00069-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="20" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00069-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="21" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="ulstermedj00069-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="22" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
