We performed a phase I study with intravenous GI147211, a new semisynthetic camptothecin analogue, using a daily x 5 schedule administered every 3 weeks, to evaluate the side-effects and pharmacokinetics of the agent. Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumour refractory to standard froms of therapy were eligible for the study. GI147211 was given as a 30 min intravenous infusion daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 3 weeks. In subsequent patient cohorts the dose was escalated from 0.3 to 1.5 mg m-2 day-1. Pharmacokinetics analysis was performed on days 1 and 4 of the first course using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic assay and non-compartmental methods. A total of 19 patients were entered into the study, one patient was not evaluable for toxicity because only one drug administration was given. Eighteen patients received a total of 67 courses through four dose levels. The dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at the dose of 1.5 mg m-2 day-1. Nadirs occurred on day 15 and day 15 respectively. Other toxicities were mild and infrequent and included nausea/vomiting, headache and alopecia. The maximal tolerated dose was 1.2 mg m-2 day-1. One partial response was observed in a patient with colorectal cancer. The total plasma clearance was 999+/-184 ml min-1 (range 640-1329). The volume of distribution was 190+/-461 m-2 and the terminal half-life was 3.7+/-1.2 h. The AUC increased linearly with the administered dose. A steep and significant sigmoid relationship was established between the AUC and the percent decrease of ANC. GI147211 is a new topoisomerase I inhibitor that induced dose-limiting neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in this phase I study. The recommended dose for phase II studies with this schedule is 1.2 mg m-2 x 5 every 3 weeks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="744" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="745" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="746" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="747" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="748" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="749" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="750" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
