Although this drug has a broad spectrum of anticancer activity, including significant activity against the common solid tumors of the gastrointestinal system, only a minority of patients treated with fluorouracil experience an objective response to therapy. Furthermore, in randomized clinical trials completed to date, it has not been possible to demonstrate that fluorouracil therapy significantly prolongs the life span of patients with advanced cancer. Recent laboratory studies have indicated that leucovorin can enhance the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil in vitro, evidently by enhancing inhibition of the key enzyme, thymidylate synthetase, by the fluorouracil metabolite, FdUMP (fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate; a stable inactive FdUMP-reduced folate-thymidylate synthetase complex is formed). Pilot, uncontrolled studies of leucovorin-fluorouracil combinations have suggested that leucovorin may significantly increase both the clinical efficacy and the clinical toxicity of fluorouracil in cancer patients. These findings have led to the initiation of several randomized, controlled studies of leucovorin plus fluorouracil versus fluorouracil alone in the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Three of these studies have recently completed patient accrual, and the preliminary results of each of the three studies indicate that leucovorin-fluorouracil combinations will have a better therapeutic index than fluorouracil used alone in this disease. Further follow-up of these studies will be needed to determine whether leucovorin-fluorouracil combination therapy will prolong the life span of patients with colorectal cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="23" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="24" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="25" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="26" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="27" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="28" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="29" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="30" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="31" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="32" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="33" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00073-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="34" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
