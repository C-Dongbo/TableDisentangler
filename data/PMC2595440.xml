To determine if the presence of this sex-linked gene is associated to any degree with the occurrence of severe bacterial infection, a study of hospitalized male patients in Iran was undertaken. As determined by erythrocyte assay, allele prevalence in male patients with infection was 22% vs. 12% in a patient group matched for the absence of other risk factors for infection and 6% in a second group who had additional risk factors for infection. When the control and patient groups were considered together the difference between the frequency of G6PD deficiency (10.2%) was significantly different from that found in the infected patients (p less than .05). Furthermore, the mean age of infected patients with G6PD deficiency was significantly less than that of infected patients without G6PD deficiency or non-infected control groups. These data suggest that host defenses may be altered in G6PD deficiency so that bacterial infections are more severe. Alternatively, G6PD deficiency and infection might represent concomittant risk factors which lead to hospitalization during bacterial infection. Potential mechanisms by which host defenses might be altered in G6PD deficiency are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="169" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="170" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="171" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="172" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="173" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="174" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="175" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="176" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="177" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="178" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00125-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="179" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
