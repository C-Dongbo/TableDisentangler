The treatment was well tolerated and the only significant toxicity observed was reversible myelosuppression as previously described. Following conventional surgery and chemotherapy, 21 out of the 52 patients had no evidence of residual disease and were regarded as receiving treatment in an adjuvant setting. To date, two of these patients have died of their disease (follow-up 3-62 months, median follow-up 35 months). This extended phase I-II study suggests that patients with advanced ovarian cancer who achieve a complete remission following conventional therapy may benefit from further treatment with intraperitoneal radioactive monoclonal antibody.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00198-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="403" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00198-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="404" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00198-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="405" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00198-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="406" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
