Systemic chemotherapy consisted of FU 400 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>and leucovorin 20 mgm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>both given as intravenous bolus injection on days 1&#x02013;4, plus cisplatin 20 mgm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>administered as 90-min infusion on days 1&#x02013;4. Treatment courses were repeated every 4 weeks &#x000d7; 6 unless prior evidence of progressive disease. Radiation therapy using megavolt irradiation of &#x02265; 6 MV photons with a 3- or 4-field technique was delivered during the second and third chemotherapy course, that was reduced in dose by 25&#x00025;. Between October 1994 and July 1996, a total of 38 patients were entered onto this trial, all of whom were assessable for toxicity and survival. Eighteen of these (47&#x00025;) had objective remissions to combined radiochemotherapy, including four CR (11&#x00025;), 13 (34&#x00025;) had stable disease and seven patients (18&#x00025;) showed tumour progression during treatment. The median progression-free interval of the entire study population was 10 months (range 3&#x02013;32), and median overall survival was 14.0 months (range 3&#x02013;45+ months); 53&#x00025; of all patients were alive at 12 months, and 18&#x00025; of patients were alive at 24 months respectively. Severe haematological side-effects comprised neutropenia in 18&#x00025;, thrombocytopenia in 8&#x00025; and anaemia in 11&#x00025;. The most frequent non-haematological side-effects were nausea/vomiting (WHO grade 3: 18&#x00025;), and diarrhoea (grade 3: 13&#x00025;). This combined radiochemotherapy regimen was tolerable and effective in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Since therapeutic results, in fact, compare favourably with other series, including surgical treatment of potentially resectable tumours, further evaluation of combined treatment modalities in the neoadjuvant setting seems warranted. &#x000a9; 2000 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>neoadjuvant</kwd><kwd>chemoradiation</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd><kwd>5-fluorouracil, leucovorin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
