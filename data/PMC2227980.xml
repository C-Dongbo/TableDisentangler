The cycle was regularly repeated at 4-month intervals and continued ad libitum in patients showing some response and in patients with progressing disease. Of 20 patients evaluable for treatment response, one (5%) had a complete response and three (15%) showed partial response. Three patients (15%) achieved stable disease and 13 (65%) were evaluated as having progressive disease. The estimated actuarial 44-month survival rate was 44%. Toxicity was limited to WHO grades 1 and 2 only.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00168-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="541" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00168-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="542" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00168-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="543" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00168-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="544" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
