The drug was given as an i.v. bolus injection at 2 mg m-2 once every 3 weeks in an outpatient setting. Prophylactic antiemetics were not routinely given. Of the 29 eligible patients, nine had been treated surgically and three had received radiotherapy. The main toxic effects observed were stomatitis (34% of cycles) and neutropenia (41% of cycles). Neutropenic fever was rare (3% of cycles). Twenty-seven patients were evaluable for response. There were four partial responses (15%), while 13 patients (48%) showed stabilisation of their disease. The median duration of response was 7 months (range 6.0-10.7 months) and median survival from the start of rhizoxin treatment was 6 months (range 2-14.7 months). Rhizoxin as single agent shows activity in patients with advanced NSCLC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00031-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="403" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00031-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="404" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00031-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="405" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
