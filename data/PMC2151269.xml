Patients received a maximum of six cycles. Plasma, urine and leucocyte MMRDX and its 13-dihydro metabolite pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in patients without liver metastases. Patients (n = 48, 21 NSCLC, 19 renal cell, three head and neck tumour, three cervical cancer and two adenocarcinoma of unknown primary) received 132 cycles of MMRDX. Common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade III/IV thrombocytopenia (12% of cycles) and neutropenia (27% of cycles) occurred with median nadir on day 22. Transient transaminases elevation &#x0003e; grade III/IV was observed in 7% of cycles, late and prolonged nausea &#x0003e; or = grade II in 34% and vomiting &#x0003e; or = grade II in 39%. In two patients, the left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced &#x0003e; or = 15%. Of 37 evaluable patients, one out of 17 NSCLC had a partial response. Mean (+/- s.d.) MMRDX AUC0-infinity calculated up to 24 h after dosing was 20.4 +/- 6.2 microg h l(-1) (n = 11) and t(1/2, gamma) was 44.2 h. Mean plasma clearance (+/- s.d.) was 37.2 +/- 7.3 l h(-1) m(-2) and volume of distribution 1982 +/- 64 l m(-2). MMRDX leucocyte levels 2 and 24 h after infusion were 450 to 600-fold higher than corresponding MMRDX plasma levels. In urine, 2% of the MMRDX dose was excreted unchanged, and 2% as metabolite. The main side-effects of 1.5 mg m(-2) every 4 weeks of MMRDX are delayed nausea and vomiting and haematological toxicity. MMRDX is characterized by extensive clearance and rapid and extensive distribution into tissues. A low response rate was observed in patients with tumours with intrinsic chemotherapy resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="139" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="140" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="141" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="142" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="143" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="144" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="145" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00077-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="146" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
