Menstrual characteristics, reproductive and contraceptive history and history of exposure to various environmental factors were compared between 235 women with histologically diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer and 451 controls. High gravidity, hysterectomy, female sterilisation and oral contraceptive use were associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Infertility and late age at menopause were associated with an increase in risk. While these factors were related, they were each found to be independently associated with ovarian cancer risk after adjusting for the effect of the other factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="592" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="593" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="594" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="595" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="596" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="597" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00120-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="598" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
