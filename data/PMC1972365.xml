Response was assessed following 12 weeks of systemic therapy by linear regression analysis of changes in tumour volume. Definitive locoregional surgery (mastectomy n = 82, wide local excision n = 6) was performed on completion of systemic therapy (3-6 months). Response was observed in 24 (39%) of the 61 patients who received endocrine therapy; all 24 had tumours with an oestrogen receptor (ER) concentration of greater than or equal to 20 fmol mb-1 cytosol protein. Cytotoxic therapy was reserved for patients with tumours of ER concentration less than 20 fmol mg-1 cytosol protein (n = 27) or when endocrine therapy had failed (n = 20). Response was observed in 34 patients (72%). The overall survival rate at 3 years was 86%, with 81% remaining free from local relapse. We propose that the treatment policy outlined in this paper should now be tested against orthodox management by controlled randomised trial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="561" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="562" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="563" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="564" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="565" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00212-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="566" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
