Cisplatin is the most widely tested cytotoxic agent in this disease. A total of 18 patients with advanced ACC were enrolled. Cytotoxic therapy consisted of etoposide (VP16) (100 mg m(-2) day(-1) on days 1-3) and cisplatin (100 mg m(-2) day(-1) on day 1) every 4 weeks. Mitotane treatment was maintained during chemotherapy in 14 patients. A complete response was observed in three cases and a partial response in three cases, giving an overall response rate of 33%. Tumour response was observed in three of the six patients with progressive disease during treatment with mitotane given at an effective dosage, as shown by serum levels &#x0003e;14 mg l(-1). Toxic effects were as expected and were non-life-threatening; no treatment interruption was required.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="546" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="547" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="548" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00004-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="549" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
