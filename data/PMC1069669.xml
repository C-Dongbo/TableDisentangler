Cell-division-tracking dyes, cell-mixing experiments, surface phenotyping, and cytokine measurements were used to investigate immunomodulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after therapy. Proliferative responses of PBMCs to allergen extract were significantly reduced after PIT. This was associated with modified cytokine profiles generally characterised by an increase in interleukin-10 and a decrease in interleukin-5 production. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated after PIT were able to actively suppress allergen-specific proliferative responses of pretreatment CD4<sup>neg</sup> PBMCs in co-culture experiments.

The role of regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) populations in maintaining homeostasis is increasingly well understood. The term T<sub>reg</sub> is used to describe a variety of T cell functional phenotypes that display common features. Several studies have described the dependence of T<sub>reg</sub> function on cell&#x02013;cell contact. In certain cases regulation was demonstrated to be dependent on IL-10 and/or transforming growth factor &#x003b2; secretion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Regulation of immune responses may be attributable to both naturally occurring (thymus-derived, or &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d;) regulatory cells and also na&#x000ef;ve or effector T cells that have acquired suppressive activity (adaptive regulatory cells) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Therapeutic administration of short, soluble peptide sequences, in the absence of inflammatory signals, may result in presentation by immature or quiescent antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Under such conditions, suppression was shown to lack antigen specificity and to be mediated by cells that did not exhibit any of the hallmarks of &#x0201c;professional&#x0201d; T<sub>reg</sub>.

The study received prior approval from the Ethics Committee of the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals National Health Service Trust (London, United Kingdom). Written, witnessed informed consent was obtained from all patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients enrolled in two consecutive studies (open study design) of immunotherapy employing short synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the major cat allergen <named-content content-type="genus-species">Felis domesticus</named-content> allergen 1 (Fel d 1). The studies employed different dosing regimes in order to evaluate dose effects on clinical and mechanistic outcomes. The first study included eight patients (referred to hereafter as Group 1) who received incremental doses of Fel d 1 peptides (0.1, 1, 1, 5, 10, and 25 &#x003bc;g) totalling 42.1 &#x003bc;g of each peptide, while the second study comprised 12 patients (referred to hereafter as Group 2) who received a total of 291 &#x003bc;g (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 100 &#x003bc;g) of each peptide. Peptides were synthesised by Fmoc chemistry, purified by HPLC, and presented as lyophilised solids (Advanced Biotechnology Centre, Imperial College London, United Kingdom). Peptides were reconstituted with sterile physiological saline and dispensed into sterile vials for single patient use (Nova Laboratories, Leicestershire, United Kingdom).

Additionally, a significant reduction (<italic>p =</italic> 0.03) in the magnitude (area in square millimeters) of the late-phase skin reaction was observed post-treatment. In the second study, treatment was associated with a reduction in the magnitude of the late asthmatic reaction induced by inhaled allergen challenge, together with a significant decrease in nasal outcome measurements (number of sneezes, nasal blockage, and weight of nasal secretion; all measurements at 15 min post-challenge, <italic>p =</italic> 0.02).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PBMC Cultures</title><p>PBMCs were isolated from venous blood by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077; Sigma Chemicals, Poole, United Kingdom) and cryopreserved. All experiments were performed on pre- and post-PIT PBMCs of the same patient in single experiments, to reduce inter-experiment variation within single patients. Prior to in vitro culture, PBMCs were thawed, washed, and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States), as follows: 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> each of pre-PIT and post-PIT PBMCs were resuspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom), and 0.5 ml of 1 &#x003bc;M CFSE added under constant, gentle agitation, to achieve a final CFSE concentration of 0.5 &#x003bc;M. After 10 min, 1 ml of human AB serum (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) was added to terminate labelling, and cells were washed twice. Cells were resuspended at 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml of complete medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with <sc>L</sc>-glutamine and 5&#x00025; human AB serum) and plated at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates (Nunc, Merck Eurolab, Lutterworth, United Kingdom) in 200 &#x003bc;l of final volume, under the following culture conditions: unstimulated, stimulated with 30 &#x003bc;g/ml whole cat allergen (generous gift of Leti Laboratories, Madrid, Spain) and stimulated with plate-bound &#x003b1;-CD3/&#x003b1;-CD28 (10/1 &#x003bc;g/ml; BD Pharmingen, Cowley, United Kingdom).</p><p>For suppression experiments, PBMCs were separated into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>neg</sup> populations.

Two distinct cell-cycle tracking dyes, CFSE and PKH-26, were employed to visually separate the target (CD4<sup>neg</sup>; CFSE) from the effector (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; PKH-26) populations, by flow cytometry. PIT resulted in a 69&#x00025; reduction (14.7&#x00025; proliferation pre-PIT versus 4.6&#x00025; proliferation post-PIT) in proliferation of the CD4<sup>neg</sup> T cell population for the one representative patient shown in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">3</xref>B). When pre- or post-PIT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were added to CD4<sup>neg</sup> PBMCs (at a ratio of 1:4), a marked reduction in proliferation of cat-allergen-specific CD4<sup>neg</sup> pre-PIT T cells was observed when co-cultured with post-PIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>E; 7.9&#x00025; proliferation) but not with pre-PIT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>C; 17.7&#x00025; proliferation), indicating that the post-PIT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells harboured a suppressor population. As post-PIT CD4<sup>neg</sup> T cell proliferation was minimal, addition of post-PIT CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells did not have a further suppressive effect on this cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Additionally, removal of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from post-PIT PBMCs did not cause the depleted PBMC population to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), suggesting that antigen-specific cells in the post-treatment population had already been rendered anergic in vivo as a result of PIT, or possessed the ability to actively suppress responses themselves. Similar experiments were performed in a further four patients. A summary of the results for all five patients is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020078-g003">Figure 3</xref>G.

A number of reports suggest that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells may be activated in the asthma process. CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood from atopic donors were found to produce IL-4 and IL-5 in lavage samples and bronchial biopsies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, individuals with severe atopic disease have high frequencies of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</named-content> 1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete significantly more IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 than non-atopic individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we have shown that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells proliferate markedly to cat allergen in vitro even in the absence of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In the context of previous studies, it appears likely that these cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Thus, induction of non-responsiveness in CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells should have a positive therapeutic outcome in allergic disease.</p><p>Cytokine profiles of cat-allergen-stimulated PBMCs were established following peptide therapy. Levels of IL-2 and IL-4 were generally below the limit of detection of the assays employed. PIT had no effect on secretion of tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (data not shown). Production of IL-5, a cytokine considered particularly relevant in asthma, was significantly reduced following PIT. In approximately half of the patients there were reductions in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. We have observed similar results in an unpublished study of PIT for bee venom hypersensitivity. The majority of patients showed increased IL-10 production after PIT, in agreement with our earlier observations. However, in the present study this did not achieve statistical significance, in contrast to a previous report. Enhanced production of IL-10 has been associated with protection from allergic symptoms in both naturally exposed individuals such as beekeepers and in individuals receiving bee venom immunotherapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, IL-10 production in relation to cat allergen exposure and protection is less well established. A protective effect of high-dose natural exposure to cat allergens (resulting in a &#x0201c;modified Th2 response&#x0201d;) has been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Woodfolk and colleagues demonstrated elevated IL-10 production in individuals displaying a &#x0201c;modified Th2&#x0201d; profile in which cat-allergen-specific IgG4 appeared to protect from disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In their study, particular regions of the Fel d 1 molecule (carboxy terminus of chain 2) appeared to be associated with presentation by HLA-DRB1&#x0002a;0701 and were associated with preferential IL-10 induction. For technical reasons, peptides from this region were not included in the preparation used in the present study. Inclusion of such peptides in future studies may enhance vaccine efficacy.</p><p>In the present study, cytokine production was evaluated in peripheral blood cells. Cytokine production at local tissues targeted by allergens may provide a more accurate picture of the effects of immunotherapy with peptides or native allergens/allergen extracts. For example, in a related study a significant increase in the number of cutaneous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IFN&#x003b3; <sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<italic>p =</italic> 0.03), but not in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-10<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, was observed in allergen-challenged skin biopsies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b27">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, a significant increase in the number of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA(&#x0002b;) cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) was found in nasal biopsies of patients enrolled in a whole-grass-pollen immunotherapy trial, in the absence of significant modifications in IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by corresponding in vitro stimulated PBMCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, in vivo localization of cells by allergen challenge may reveal patterns of immunomodulation that differ from changes in the blood of the same individual. For this reason, caution should be exercised when interpreting alterations in cytokine profiles in different tissues following immunotherapy.</p><p>We addressed the possibility that changes in T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion may be related to the induction of a population of T<sub>reg</sub> or suppressor T cells, similar to that observed following peptide intervention in murine models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;. PBMCs were separated into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>neg</sup> populations. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from post-PIT blood were able to actively suppress the proliferation of pre-treatment CD4<sup>neg</sup> cells. The selection of CD4<sup>neg</sup> cells, rather than CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, as targets was due to limitations in the number of cells available. Nevertheless, the results obtained indicate the induction of regulatory and suppressor CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells following PIT. Interestingly, removal of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from the post-PIT PBMC population did not lead to a reversal of the allergen-specific hyporesponsiveness in the pre-PIT CD4<sup>neg</sup> population. This observation suggests that in addition to active suppression by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, enduring effects of therapy can also be detected. Explanations for such observations may include the following: (i) clonal deletion of some antigen-specific CD4<sup>neg</sup> cells, (ii) the induction of anergy in these cells during the treatment phase, or (iii) the presence of a CD4<sup>neg</sup> suppressor population. In support of the last possibility, regulatory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have recently been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies identifying allergen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells will be required to address such issues. In future studies it will be of interest to identify the subpopulation or subpopulations of CD4 and CD8 cells responsible for the suppressive effect, by removing candidate T cells from the pre- and post-treatment CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell populations prior to co-culture.</p><p>No increase in numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was observed in PBMCs following PIT, in contrast to studies of whole allergen immunotherapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, numbers of CD25<sup>bright</sup> cells significantly decreased following peptide therapy (data not shown). Furthermore, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells obtained before and after treatment in a related PIT study did not differ in their ability to suppress allergen-specific effector T cell proliferation and IL-13 production, arguing against a major role for this type of regulatory cell in peptide therapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;. We speculate that PIT results in T cell activation in the absence of inflammatory signals, possibly via presentation by immature APCs, or even by neighbouring T cells. Well-characterised in vitro human models have demonstrated that it is indeed possible to induce T cell anergy following incubation with cognate peptide in the absence of professional APCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;.

Additionally, Prakken and colleagues have demonstrated induction of IL-10-secreting T<sub>reg</sub> following oral peptide therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These cells may similarly represent an induced population of adaptive T<sub>reg</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>While CD25 expression is considered to be a marker of a functionally distinct population of T<sub>reg</sub> (provided the cells have not been recently activated), CD5 expression levels on T cells may be an indicator of a regulatory function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. CD5 has been shown to be a negative regulator of TCR signalling, influencing the fate of developing thymocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In the periphery, CD5<sup>neg</sup> T cells show enhanced proliferation to TCR triggering &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, increased membrane levels of CD5 correlate with a lowering of the T cell response to antigen by targeting downstream signalling events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the current study, CD5 levels were significantly elevated on directly ex vivo, unstimulated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, following peptide therapy. The increases were slight, which likely relates to the low precursor frequency of the cells targeted. Interestingly, the increases observed on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were partly due to a reduction in the size of the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD5<sup>neg</sup> T cell population. A distinct CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD5<sup>neg</sup> T cell population that accounts for 3&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the total CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell population in healthy donors has previously been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b48">48</xref>&#x0005d; and appears to be the main producer of lymphotactin (XCL-1) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;. As the average size of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD5<sup>neg</sup> T cell populations in the allergic asthmatic patients in our study is substantially larger (23.2&#x00025; of the total CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells), it is tempting to speculate that this is further evidence for a dysregulated immune response associated with allergic disease. This observation is in agreement with data from lymphopenic mice that developed wasting disease with accelerated kinetics following adoptive transfer of T cells expressing low levels of CD5, whilst CD5<sup>hi</sup> cells were protective &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with these findings, surface levels of CD5 on human T cells also appear to correlate with immune function, as the CD5<sup>neg</sup> population was increased in bone marrow transplant recipients as well as in patients with advanced AIDS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as relatively little is known about the role of CD5 in human T cell tolerance, further investigations are required to establish the relevance of our finding in allergic disease. Isolating Fel d 1&#x02013;specific T cells should yield valuable information on the functional relevance of increased CD5 expression on allergen-specific cells.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that PIT induces a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell population that actively suppresses antigen-induced proliferation of effector T cells. The use of dual labelling with distinctly coloured dyes allowed evaluation of the effect of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subset on the proliferation of CD4<sup>neg</sup> (including CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, natural killer cells, B cells, monocytes, and basophils) using flow cytometry. While dual labelling has been widely used to track cell migration in animal models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d;, its application in in vitro human T cell proliferation experiments has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. Single-colour labelling of distinct human PBMC populations has been used to characterise, isolate, and clone peanut-allergen-specific T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b53">53</xref>&#x0005d; and to determine precursor frequencies of recall-antigen-specific T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Measurement of proliferation by means of CFSE has the additional advantages of requiring relatively low numbers of cells and allowing additional phenotypic (cell surface markers) or functional parameters (intracellular cytokine secretion) to be studied in parallel, in distinct subpopulations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020078-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that low-dose PIT targets both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells and induces a population of active suppressor/regulatory T cells within the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> compartment. Suppressor activity may also reside within the CD4<sup>neg</sup> compartment. Peptide therapy resulted in a heterogeneous modulation of allergen-specific PBMC cytokine responses in vitro, generally characterised by IL-10 induction and IL-5 suppression. Finally, modest but consistent increases were observed in surface CD5 expression on both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, an observation that may be linked to the induction of antigen-specific hyporesponsiveness. The ability to modulate antigen-specific T cell function in vivo has important implications for the treatment and prevention of allergic, autoimmune, and allograft-related diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><p><bold>Accession Numbers</bold></p><p>The SwissProt (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/</ext-link>) accession numbers for the gene products discussed in this paper are CD5 (P06127), DEC-205 (Q60767), Fel d 1 chain 1 (P30438), Fel d 1 chain 2 (P30440), and lymphotactin (P47992).</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>Increasing numbers of people are developing allergies to pets and becoming asthmatic.
