An overall response rate of 40.4% was observed in 47 evaluable patients, which included one complete response and 18 partial responses. Responses were achieved in 61.1% of stage 3 patients and 27.6% of stage 4 patients. The median progression-free interval was 19.3 weeks, and median survival time was 41.6 weeks (47.1 weeks for patients with stage 3 disease and 38.7 weeks for those with stage 4 disease). Toxicity was well tolerated. Gastrointestinal and renal toxicities did not exceed WHO grade 2. Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia and anaemia occurred in nine (19%) and four (9%) patients respectively, but only grade 2 thrombocytopenia was observed. Phlebitis at the infusion site was observed in 24 patients (53%). This treatment programme achieved a response rate similar to other active combination regimens for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and was less toxic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00037-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1096" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00037-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1097" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00037-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1098" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00037-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1099" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00037-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1100" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
