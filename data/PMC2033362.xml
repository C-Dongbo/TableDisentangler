Two patients relapsed prior to ABMT. All patients were conditioned with high-dose melphalan. In Addition, ten received fractionated total body irradiation, one hemi-body irradiation and four high-dose etoposide. Unmanipulated non-cryopreserved autologous marrow was reinfused within 56 h of harvesting. Engraftment occurred in all patients with a median of 11 days of neutropenia (&#x0003c; 0.5 x 10(9) l-1), a median requirement for platelet transfusion of 3 days and packed red cell transfusion of 2 units, with a median hospital stay of 18 days post transplant. There was no procedure-related mortality and only minor morbidity was observed. Two patients relapsed at 1 and 2 months post transplantation, and one patient died of carcinoma of the lung 33 months after transplantation. The remaining 25 patients remain alive, well and in CR1 with a median follow-up of 44 months. The event-free survival at 3 years for all patients considered for ABMT was 83%. We conclude that ABMT for high-grade NHL in CR1 with non-cryopreserved marrow results in rapid haematological recovery without growth factor support. It is safe and is associated with high survival when used as consolidation of CR in high-risk patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="501" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="502" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="503" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="504" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="505" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
