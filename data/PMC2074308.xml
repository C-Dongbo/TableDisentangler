The patients, between 15 and 80 years old with performance status (PS) of 0-2, received at least two cycles of docetaxel 60 mg m-2 intravenously at 3-4 week intervals. Of the 81 patients enrolled, the 72 eligible for the study were given a total of 327 cycles, with a median of four cycles each. Five patients obtained a complete response (CR) and 27 a partial response (PR); the response rate (RR) was 44.4% (95% confidence interval 32.7-56.6%). A relatively high RR of 9/28 (32.1%) was observed in patients who had received prior chemotherapy involving anthracyclines. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3-4 leucocytopenia or neutropenia, found in 78.9% and 85.9% patients respectively. Other severe (grade &#x0003e; 3) toxicities included alopecia (38%), anorexia (18.3%), nausea/vomiting (11.3%), and fatigue (9.9%). Hypersensitivity reactions, oedema and skin toxicity were not severe and were reversible. One therapy-related death occurred 10 days after the initial dose was given. These findings indicate that docetaxel has potent activity against metastatic breast cancer, and that the dose of 60 mg m-2 is safe.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="210" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="211" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="212" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="213" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="214" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="215" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00030-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="216" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
