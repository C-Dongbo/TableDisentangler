Three groups of patients received a median of four (range 2-4) cycles of combination chemotherapy: group I operable primary (n = 10); group II, locally advanced disease (n = 20); group III, recurrent locoregional disease (n = 22). The response rates (complete response, partial response and mixed response) in these groups of patients were 100% in groups I and II and 86% in group III. Morbidity included drug streaming and dysaesthesia in the hand. Patients in groups I and II had their tumours downstaged, allowing surgery to be performed. Local control was also achieved in group III when other treatment modalities had failed.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0180-a" xlink:role="606"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 3</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0181-a" xlink:role="607"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="605" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="606" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="607" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="608" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="609" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
