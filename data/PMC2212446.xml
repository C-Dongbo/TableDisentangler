Within a few weeks of starting antiviral  therapy, there is a marked decline in IgG-ASC frequency in both acutely and chronically infected people, whereas the hypergammaglobulinemia often present during chronic infection is  more gradually resolved. These reductions are sustained while HIV-1 replication is suppressed.  HIV-1 antigen&#x02013;specific B cell responses are also affected by therapy, manifested by a rapid decline in circulating gp120-specific ASCs. Anti-gp120 titers slowly decrease in chronically infected individuals and usually fail to mature in acutely infected individuals who were promptly  treated with antiretroviral therapy. Long-term nonprogressors have high titer antibody responses to HIV-1 antigens, but no detectable gp120-specific IgG-ASC, and normal (or subnormal) levels of total circulating IgG-ASC. Overall, we conclude that HIV-1 infection drives B  cell hyperactivity, and that this polyclonal activation is rapidly responsive to decreases in viral  replication caused by combination antiviral therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypergammaglobulinemia</kwd><kwd>human immunodeficiency virus 1</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>antiretroviral therapy</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1  (HIV-1) is associated with several abnormalities of B cell  function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In consequence, individuals who have been  infected with HIV-1 for several years (chronic infection)  are often hypergammaglobulinemic, with elevations in  plasma IgG of up to twice the normal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).  Most of the excess antibody is not HIV-1 antigen&#x02013;specific,  reflecting instead a generalized, polyclonal activation of B  cell functions caused by systemic HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).  Consistent with this, B cells from HIV-1&#x02013;infected people  spontaneously secrete IgG in culture to a much greater extent than cells from uninfected individuals, yet respond relatively poorly to B cell mitogens in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Once they  develop, these abnormalities are sustained throughout the  course of infection. However, what drives them is unclear.</p><p>Superimposed on these polyclonal responses are strong,  antigen-specific B cell responses to multiple HIV-1 antigens, the most dominant being to the viral Env (gp120 and  gp41) and Gag (p24 and p17) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The antigen-specific responses are initiated within a few weeks of infection (seroconversion) and increase in magnitude for &#x0223c;1 yr  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, the anti-Env and anti-Gag responses  differ in the extent to which they are sustained throughout  the course of HIV-1 infection. Anti-Env antibodies are  usually present at high titers even in individuals who  progress to disease, often right until death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In  contrast, anti-Gag responses are lost (or in some cases never  fully develop) during disease progression; a low anti-Gag  titer is a poor prognostic indicator, associated with low  CD4 T cell counts and high viral loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This is  paradoxical considering the lack of antiviral function associated with anti-Gag antibodies, but it is thought that the decline in the anti-Gag response is a surrogate marker for the  loss of T cell help caused by HIV-1 infection of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Why the anti-Env response is so  strongly sustained under these T cell help&#x02013;depleted conditions is unresolved, but we have suggested that it may reflect  the existence of alternative antigen presentation pathways  for the highly glycosylated envelope glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Although the abnormalities in B cell function and the  antigen-specific production of anti&#x02013;HIV-1 antibodies are  both responses to HIV-1 infection, their dependence on  sustained viral replication has not been defined. Nor is it  clear that they are driven by the same mechanisms. The development of combinations of potent antiretroviral drugs  (protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors) that can suppress HIV-1 replication by several orders of magnitude in  vivo has now allowed us to examine these questions. Specifically, we have assessed how the different B cell responses change when viremia is suppressed. We show that  sustained reductions in plasma viremia after antiviral therapy cause the numbers of gp120-specific and total IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASC)<sup>1</sup> to decline within a few days.  Plasma anti-gp120 and anti-p24 antibody titers in chronically  infected individuals decline much more gradually, and hypergammaglobulinemia is also eventually resolved. When  therapy is initiated during acute HIV-1 infection, the IgG-ASC frequency again decreases rapidly, and in most cases antigen-specific responses are also diminished or fail to increase.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Study Subjects.</title><p>Cohort 1 comprised 19 drug-naive individuals, 16 of whom were screened for entry into a phase I clinical  trial of an antiviral regimen involving three reverse transcriptase  inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine, and abacavir) and one experimental protease inhibitor (141W94) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Of these individuals, 4 had been infected with HIV-1 for &#x0003c;90 d (acute infection)  and 12 had been infected for between 4 mo and 12 yr (chronic  infection). The four acutely infected cases and six of the chronically infected cases met the criteria for entry into the trial, initiated therapy, and were followed longitudinally for up to 30 wk  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The remaining six chronically infected individuals did not  participate in the trial, so provide only baseline, pretherapy data.  Also included in cohort 1 are three long-term nonprogressors  (LTNPs), two of whom have been described previously (individuals AD-19 and AD-65; references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). An additional individual  (S006) who had been infected for 1&#x02013;2 yr had no detectable plasma  viremia (&#x0003c;100 RNA copies/ml in the branched DNA [bDNA]  assay), with a CD4 count of 413. He was not formally included  among the LTNPs in cohort 1 because of the short duration of his  infection, but is referred to in the context of studies on LTNPs as  a prospective slow progressor with undetectable plasma viremia.  All participants gave written informed consent for all the studies  described below. Adherence to therapy was confirmed by interview and by the absence of any resurgence in viral loads, measured  using the bDNA assay. Nonadherence is noted in the text below. </p><p>Longitudinal studies that required fresh cells were performed  only on 10 members of cohort 1. However, an additional cohort  was also formed. Cohort 2 comprises 13 participants in a phase I  clinical trial of a different 4-drug regimen (reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine and lamivudine; protease inhibitors saquinavir  and ritonavir; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). 3 of the participants were acutely infected  with HIV-1, and 10 were chronically infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The median  CD4 count for the 10 chronically infected individuals was 434  cells/&#x003bc;l (range 260&#x02013;910), and for the 3 acutely infected individuals, it was 399 cells/&#x003bc;l (range 136&#x02013;1,039). Each individual had  been treated for between 16 and 36 wk before this immunological study was initiated, so samples were only available for assays  that could be performed prospectively. All 13 participants had  undetectable levels of plasma viremia (&#x0003c;100 RNA copies/ml in  the reverse transcriptase PCR assay) at the time we analyzed their  circulating IgG-ASC frequencies. </p><p>From cohorts 1 and 2, individuals no. 896 (cohort 1) and no.  2004 (cohort 2) can be defined as having progressive HIV-1 infection, based on their CD4 counts and viral loads (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).  Six uninfected laboratory workers formed a control group relevant to both cohorts 1 and 2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Clinical Assays.</title><p>Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were determined  using the bDNA assay (cohort 1; Chiron Mimotopes, San Diego,  CA) or a reverse transcriptase PCR assay from Roche Labs.

PBMCs were isolated within 4 h of collection by  Ficoll gradient separation. The cells were washed three times (at  1,000 rpm for 10 min) in cold PBS to remove platelets and resuspended at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS  (R-10 medium).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>ELISPOT Assay.</title><p>MultiScreen 96-well filtration plates (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="millipore">Millipore</named-content>, Bedford, MA) were coated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with either goat  anti&#x02013;human IgM Fc or goat anti&#x02013;human IgG Fc (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical  Co.</named-content>, St. Louis, MO) at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml in PBS (pH 7.4) for detection  of total IgM-specific or IgG-specific ASCs, respectively. For detection of anti-gp120 ASCs, the wells were coated with the sheep  anti-gp120 antibody D7324 (Aalto BioReagents, Dublin, Ireland)  followed by rgp120 JR-FL (a gift from Paul Maddon, Progenics  Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, NY) at 100 ng/ml in PBS. To  detect anti-p24 ASCs, the wells were directly coated with glutathione-S-transferase&#x02013;p24 fusion protein at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml (the vector  construct was a gift from Ian Jones, NERC Institute of Virology,  Oxford, UK). All plates were washed three times with 200 &#x003bc;l of  PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-T), blocked with 3% BSA  in PBS for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, and then washed with R-10 medium.  Four serial threefold dilutions of PBMCs from a stock at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml  were prepared in R-10 medium, and 200 &#x003bc;l aliquots were added  to each well. The plates were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C in a  humidified incubator, and the cells were removed by washing the  wells six times with PBS-T. Antibodies secreted from the cells and  bound to the plate were detected by incubation for 2 h at room  temperature with alkaline phosphatase&#x02013;conjugated anti&#x02013;human  IgG Fc (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) or anti&#x02013;human  IgM&#x02002;&#x003bc; chain (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>), followed by three washes in  PBS-T and one in PBS, and the addition of NBT/BCIP (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4 chloro-3-indoyl phosphate <italic>p</italic>-toluidine salt) substrate for 15 min (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>, Gaithersburg, MD). The plates were rinsed in tap water and allowed to  dry before blue spots (positive reactions) were counted using a  dissecting microscope. The ELISPOT assay was highly reproducible; duplicate samples provided ASC frequencies within twofold  of each other. Control experiments showed that there was negligible binding of cells to wells in the absence of coating antibodies  or antigen.</p><p>To monitor the efficiency of the ELISPOT assay, B cell lines  secreting IgG mAbs to gp120 (A32, an Epstein Barr virus&#x02013;transformed B cell line from James Robinson, Tulane University,  New Orleans, LA) or p24 (1D7, a human heterohybridoma line  from Herman Katinger, Institute of Applied Microbiology, Vienna, Austria) were used as positive controls. Approximately 5%  of the cells from the A32 line and &#x0003e;50% of the cells from the ID7  line produced ELISPOTS on gp120- or p24-coated plates, respectively; these differing sensitivities are probably attributable to  the much larger size and higher levels of antibody production of  the 1D7 cells. The numbers of spots were approximately twofold  lower when wells were coated with anti-IgG Fc to detect total  IgG. Thus the antigen-specific assay was slightly more sensitive  than the total IgG assay. Subsequent studies showed that use of an  anti-IgG Fab coating antibody (Accurate Chemicals) instead of  the anti-IgG Fc allowed more sensitive detection. However, this  reagent was not used routinely in the clinical studies, so our total  ASC numbers are an underestimate by a factor of approximately  two. This does not affect any of the relative values recorded below.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Measurement of Antibodies in Culture Supernatants and Plasma.</title><p>PBMCs were cultured at 10<sup>6</sup>/well in 24-well plates in 2 ml of R-10  medium. After 8 d, supernatants were collected and anti-gp120  and anti-p24 antibody titers were measured by ELISA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Plasma anti-gp120 and anti-p24 titers were  also determined by this method. Titers are presented as the  plasma dilution at which the mid-point of the antibody&#x02013;antigen  titration curve was reached; low titers were calculated by extrapolation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Total IgG titers in culture  supernatants were measured in the same way except that the  plates were coated with goat anti&#x02013;human IgG Fc (5 &#x003bc;g/ml;  <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>). Total IgG concentrations in plasma were  determined by a commercial laboratory (SmithKline Beecham  Laboratories, Syosset, NY).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical Analyses.</title><p>IgG-ASC and IgM-ASC numbers and  levels of secreted IgG in different groups in cohort 1 were compared using a Mann-Whitney nonparametric test, and <italic>P</italic> values  &#x0003c;0.05 are reported.

Statistical estimates for the half-life  of IgG-ASC for eight members of cohort 1 were obtained either  by logarithmic linear regression analysis or by determining the  rate of descent between two consecutive time points. Half-lives  for the rate of clearance of excess plasma IgG and the decay in  anti-gp120 and anti-p24 titers were calculated by nonlinear fitting  of an exponential model with a nonzero asymptote. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Correlation between Circulating IgG-ASC Frequency and  Plasma Viremia in HIV-1&#x02013;infected Individuals.</title><p>To measure  the number of circulating ASCs, including those specific  for HIV-1 antigens, we used an ELISPOT assay since this  allows direct quantification of the numbers of B cells activated in vivo without further cultivation and stimulation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Preliminary experiments indicated that it was necessary to use freshly isolated PBMCs in the ELISPOT assay;  a freeze&#x02013;thaw cycle or even storing the cells, refrigerated,  overnight resulted in a significant reduction in the ASC  frequencies recorded. This practical consideration meant  that we could not analyze blood samples retrospectively  with the ELISPOT assay. We therefore studied individuals  who were willing to provide fresh blood on a regular basis.</p><p>Baseline ASC frequencies were measured using samples  from 18 of the 19 drug-naive HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals  (cohort 1). Subject no. 896 was not included in this analysis  as he had already been receiving therapy for 3 wk before  the availability of the first blood sample so no baseline determination was possible. Of the 18 people studied, 4 had  been infected with HIV-1 for &#x0003c;90 d (acute infection), 11  for between 4 mo and 12 yr (chronic infection), and 3  were LTNPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). ASC frequencies were also determined in 6 uninfected individuals for comparison. The frequencies of IgG-ASC in both acutely (median 1,683/10<sup>6</sup>  PBMCs) and chronically (2,185/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs) infected individuals were significantly elevated (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) compared  with uninfected donors (177/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs), although the  range was very broad (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>a</italic>). However, the LTNPs had  low levels of circulating IgG-ASC (91/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs) that  were slightly lower than those in uninfected individuals.  On average, IgG-ASC constituted around 0.2% of total  PBMCs (range 0.03&#x02013;0.46%) for acutely and chronically infected members of cohort 1. </p><p>Unlike IgG-ASC frequencies, IgM-ASC levels were not  significantly elevated in HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals; only  three chronically infected people had IgM-ASC frequencies that were higher than those in normal donors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>  <italic>b</italic>). The LTNPs (and also the aviremic individual no. S006)  had no measurable IgM-ASC, whereas all the acutely and  most of the chronically infected individuals and the uninfected controls had low, but detectable, levels. Thus, B cell  hyperactivity in HIV-1 infection predominantly comprises  memory B cells expressing surface IgG, reactivated in a  largely non&#x02013;antigen-specific manner, and is not a more  generalized phenomenon.</p><p>In addition to measuring IgG-ASC frequencies by  ELISPOT, we also quantitated spontaneous IgG secretion  from B cells cultured for 8 d. B cells from HIV-1&#x02013;infected  individuals (other than the LTNPs) secreted significantly  more IgG than B cells from uninfected people (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05;  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> <italic>c</italic>). There was considerable donor-to-donor variation  in the extent of IgG secretion, which correlated with the  variable IgG-ASC frequencies in the same individuals.  Only a small fraction of the secreted IgG was gp120-specific, and even less was p24-specific (data not shown). B  cells from the LTNPs did not secrete detectable amounts of  IgG in culture, consistent with the almost complete absence of IgG-ASC in these cultures.</p><p>Comparing the IgG-ASC frequencies in the blood with  plasma HIV-1 RNA levels showed that there was a positive  correlation between these parameters (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.52, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05;  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The highest IgG-ASC frequency was found in an  acutely infected individual (no. 902; 4,640 IgG-ASC/10<sup>6</sup>  PBMCs) who also had the highest viral load (383,000  RNA copies/ml). The individuals with the lowest viral  loads (the LTNP and slow progressor no. S006) had almost  undetectable levels of IgG-ASC. A positive correlation was  still evident when the three LTNPs were excluded, but this  no longer reached statistical significance (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.51, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d;  0.052). In addition, there was no correlation between CD4  count and IgG-ASC frequency, both for the group as a  whole (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 18) and when the three LTNPs were excluded. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Antiviral Therapy Rapidly Reduces the Numbers of Circulating IgG-ASCs.</title><p>The baseline studies indicated that B cell  hyperactivity (elevated IgG-ASC frequency) was associated  with the extent of HIV-1 replication (plasma viremia). To  determine whether a reduction in viral replication also  lowered the IgG-ASC frequency, we studied four acutely  and six chronically infected individuals from cohort 1 who  participated in a combination antiviral therapy trial involving one protease inhibitor and three reverse transcriptase  inhibitors. IgG-ASC frequencies were measured longitudinally in these 10 individuals over a 6&#x02013;20-wk period.</p><p>Plasma viremia was rapidly reduced in each recipient of  combination therapy. None of the 10 participants had a detectable viral load after 6 wk of therapy, as determined using a bDNA assay with a sensitivity limit of &#x0223c;100 HIV-1  RNA copies/ml. This was associated with a substantial reduction in the number of circulating IgG-ASCs in each individual who had an initially elevated level, irrespective of  whether they were acutely or chronically infected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).  By 6&#x02013;10 wk after therapy was initiated, the median IgG-ASC frequency for all 10 participants at baseline (2,185/10<sup>6</sup>  PBMCs) had been reduced by 5.8-fold to 378/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs,  only slightly elevated compared with the frequency in uninfected controls (177/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs). However, the median  reduction for the seven individuals who had the highest  baseline IgG-ASC frequencies was 8-fold, and the extent of  the reduction could be as high as 29-fold (e.g., no. 902) (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>a</italic>). The extent of spontaneous IgG secretion from B cells in  culture was also reduced after antiviral therapy, consistent  with the reduction in the circulating IgG-ASC frequency.  Thus, in 10 individuals from cohort 1 who were included  in the trial, the median pretherapy IgG-secretion level was  215 ng/ml, and the post-therapy level was 13 ng/ml (data  not shown). </p><p>Subject no. 902's IgG-ASC frequency declined rapidly as  his viral load dropped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>a</italic>). However, before the visit  at week 20 he discontinued the therapeutic regimen for 10 d,  resuming treatment 1 wk before returning to the clinic. A  transient resurgence in IgG-ASC frequency was then noted  at week 20 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>a</italic>; <italic>asterisk</italic>). All other participants reported strict adherence to the regimen and their levels of  IgG-ASC remained depressed during the study period. The  individual with the highest IgG-ASC frequency (no. 896;  751/10<sup>6</sup> cells) after 8 wk of therapy was chronically infected, with advanced disease and a CD4 count of 12 cells/ &#x003bc;l (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The decline in IgG-ASC frequency was usually rapid, either coincident with the decline in plasma viremia or commencing shortly thereafter, although the kinetics of the decline varied between individuals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Data derived  from 8 of the 10 recipients were used to estimate the half-life of circulating IgG-ASCs (too few data points were  available for no. 909, and reliable data could not be obtained from no. 895). This was calculated to be between 7  and 26 d (1&#x02013;3.5 wk) with a median of 16 d, and was similar  in both acutely and chronically infected individuals. These  are likely to be minimum estimates, given that viral RNA  can still be measured during the first few weeks of treatment. More frequent sampling of blood during the early  stages of therapy would have refined our estimates, but this  was not always possible. </p><p>It should be noted that the above half-lives reflect  changes in the IgG-ASC frequency as a dynamic population in the peripheral blood. Thus, we have not determined whether the decline in IgG-ASC frequency in the  blood, calculated as a half-life above, is due to the death of  these cells, to their reversion to a quiescent state, to their  redistribution into other tissue compartments, or to a reduction in the generation of new IgG-ASCs. Any or all of  these factors could contribute to the overall reduction in  IgG-ASC frequency observed, and to the rate at which it  occurs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Sustained Reduction in IgG-ASC Frequency after Antiviral  Therapy.</title><p>To determine whether the reduction in circulating IgG-ASCs caused by combination therapy was a prolonged effect, we studied a separate cohort who had been  receiving combination therapy for up to 36 wk (cohort 2).  The 10 chronically infected individuals had been treated  with a 4-drug regimen for between 32 and 36 wk, including two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and two protease  inhibitors. Since the ELISPOT assay can only be performed on freshly isolated PBMCs, we were unable to determine baseline IgG-ASC frequencies retrospectively for  cohort 2. However, it is reasonable to assume that it would  have been broadly comparable to the baseline level in the  chronically infected members of cohort 1 (2,185 IgG-ASC/ 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs). The median IgG-ASC frequency in cohort 2  after 32&#x02013;36 wk of therapy was low (339/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs), and  comparable to that in cohort 1 after 6&#x02013;8 wk of therapy (378/ 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs). This suggests that the rapid reduction in B cell  hyperactivity upon therapy is indeed a sustained effect.</p><p>The median IgG-ASC frequency in three acutely infected  individuals treated for 16&#x02013;36 wk with this second 4-drug  regimen (cohort 2) was also low (292/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs), and  very similar to the median for individuals treated during  acute infection in cohort 1 (291/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs). However,  one individual (no. 2004) still had a high IgG-ASC frequency after 16 wk of therapy (898 IgG-ASC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs).  This individual also had a low CD4 T cell count (136 cells/ &#x003bc;l). This profile is similar to individual no. 896 in cohort 1  who also had progressive infection (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>b</italic> and 4 <italic>b</italic>);  whether this poor response to antiretroviral therapy will be  the norm for individuals with advanced disease will require  further studies. The presence of elevated number of IgG-ASCs in these two individuals after therapy does, however,  suggest that the reductions in IgG-ASC frequencies seen in  other cases are not due to a direct effect of the antiviral  drugs on B cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>HIV-1 Antigen&#x02013;specific IgG-ASC Frequencies and Specific Antibody Titers: Responses to Antiviral Therapy.</title><p>To see whether  antiviral therapy also affected HIV-1 antigen&#x02013;specific B cell  responses in our study cohorts, we determined the frequencies of IgG-ASC specific for gp120 and p24, and the plasma  antibody titers to the same proteins. Specific IgG-ASC frequencies were measured by ELISPOT using plates coated  with recombinant gp120 or p24 proteins. Antibody titers  were determined by ELISA, using the same proteins.</p><p>At baseline, most members of cohort 1 had low levels of  gp120-specific IgG-ASC, which constituted only a minor  proportion of the total number of IgG-ASCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and  data not shown). Only two of the four acutely infected individuals had a detectable level of gp120-specific IgG-ASCs (16 and 5 anti-gp120 ASC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively;  &#x0003c;0.2% of total IgG-ASCs), whereas none of the LTNPs  did. Anti-gp120 IgG-ASCs were present at greater frequency in the chronically infected individuals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>b</italic> and  data not shown); 8 of the 11 had from 15 to 429 anti-gp120 ASCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, equivalent to 0.6&#x02013;14.9% of the  total IgG-ASCs. </p><p>The three chronically infected individuals whose circulating gp120-specific IgG-ASC frequency exceeded 5% of  the total IgG-ASCs responded to antiviral therapy by losing  all detectable gp120-specific IgG-ASCs within 3 wk, and  this loss persisted for the duration of the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>b</italic>).  Consistent with this, only 3 of the 10 chronically infected  individuals who had been treated for 36 wk (cohort 2) had  detectable gp120-specific IgG-ASCs, and then only at very  low levels (&#x0003c;20/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs). The proportion of IgG-ASC specific for p24 was even lower than that for gp120;  these cells were detected in only four drug-naive subjects  (one acute and three chronic) from cohort 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and  data not shown). After treatment, anti-p24 IgG-ASCs were  no longer detectable in these individuals, nor could any be  detected in either the members of cohort 2 who had been  treated for a longer period or the LTNPs.</p><p>Despite the reductions in HIV-1 antigen&#x02013;specific IgG-ASC frequencies after therapy was initiated, the plasma  anti-gp120 and anti-p24 antibody titers in most members  of cohort 1 did not decline significantly over the 12&#x02013;30-wk  study period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In one subject (no. 902), the antibody  titers actually continued to increase at a time when the  numbers of circulating anti-gp120 ASCs were declining.  However, this individual was poorly adherent to antiviral  therapy and showed a later resurgence in both total IgG-ASCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> <italic>a</italic>) and gp120-specific IgG-ASCs, as well as  the sustained anti-gp120 titer increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> <italic>a</italic>). This may  limit any inferences that can be drawn.</p><p>The data presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> suggest that there is little relationship between plasma antibody levels and the frequency of antigen-specific and -nonspecific ASCs in peripheral blood. We confirmed this by directly comparing  these parameters. Total plasma IgG concentrations and the  frequency of total IgG-ASCs in the 18 examined members  of cohort 1 (pretherapy values) are not correlated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>a</italic>).  This is because infection for &#x0003c;1 yr is often associated with  a high circulating IgG-ASC frequency in the absence of  hypergammaglobulinemia, which presumably takes some  time to develop. For most individuals, there was no correlation between the anti-gp120 IgG-ASC frequency and the  anti-gp120 antibody titers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>b</italic>). Individuals with the  highest anti-gp120 and anti-p24 titers (LTNPs) had no circulating gp120- or p24-specific IgG-ASCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>b</italic> and  data not shown). However, one acutely infected individual  (no. 911) with no detectable anti-gp120 antibodies also had  no detectable gp120-specific IgG-ASCs. In addition, the  chronically infected individual with the highest anti-gp120  titer (no. 893) also had the highest gp120-specific IgG-ASC frequency. Both these outliers (no. 911 and no. 893)  are marked by asterisks on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> <italic>b</italic>. Their inclusion in the  data set does allow a correlation between anti-gp120 IgG-ASC frequency and anti-gp120 titer to be made (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.81;  <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01). However, we have reservations about the generality of this apparent correlation since omission of the outliers generated an <italic>r</italic> value of &#x02212;0.17, which is not significant. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Antiretroviral Therapy Resolves Hypergammaglobulinemia and  Diminishes HIV-1&#x02013;specific Antibody Responses.</title><p>Hypergammaglobulinemia (plasma IgG levels &#x0003e;16.2 mg/ml in Caucasians) is a manifestation of chronic HIV-1 infection but  usually takes time to develop. Only the two members of  cohort 1 who had been infected for at least 5 yr (nos. 893  and 896) were hypergammaglobulinemic; neither the  acutely infected individuals nor those infected for &#x0003c;5 yr  had elevated plasma IgG levels despite having high IgG-ASC frequencies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). After antiviral therapy was initiated, both of these individuals remained hypergammaglobulinemic over a 16-wk period, despite the rapid reduction  in IgG-ASC frequency (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). No later samples  were available from these individuals.</p><p>Both baseline and longitudinal studies of plasma IgG levels could be performed on cohort 2, since IgG concentrations can be determined retrospectively from frozen samples. This allowed us to study changes in plasma IgG  concentrations over a longer period of time. At baseline, 5  of the 10 chronically infected individuals had IgG levels  &#x0003e;16.2 mg/ml (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). After 32&#x02013;36 wk of therapy,  plasma IgG concentrations were reduced in all 10 participants, including those not originally considered to be hypergammaglobulinemic (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The most pronounced  falls in plasma IgG were observed in the two African-American participants (nos. 1007 and 1008), although their  levels were still high at the end of the study (18.5 and 18.6  mg/ml, respectively). However, African-Americans have  naturally higher plasma IgG concentrations than do Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), so the post-therapy level observed may not be  abnormal for these two individuals. There were also minor  reductions in plasma IgG concentrations in the three  acutely infected individuals after therapy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the studies on cohorts 1 and 2 indicate  that hypergammaglobulinemia is resolved by combination  antiviral therapy, but not as rapidly as is the reduction in  IgG-ASC frequency. This is not surprising since the half-life of IgG in plasma is &#x0223c;3 wk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), so it would take some  time for a reduction in plasma IgG to be manifested, even if  all excess IgG production were simultaneously stopped.  However, little or no reduction in plasma IgG levels was  observed in two members of cohort 1 after 16 wk of therapy (five IgG half-lives), implying that hypergammaglobulinemia is not as quickly resolved as it theoretically could be  if all the excess IgG production were due to circulating  IgG-ASCs. Since plasma IgG concentrations were reduced  in all members of cohort 2 after 32&#x02013;36 wk (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), we  determined more accurately the kinetics of the decline in  the four individuals with the greatest initial plasma IgG levels (nos. 1007, 1008, 1010, and 1013; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). After therapy, plasma IgG concentrations decayed to a relatively stable level that was within the normal range for Caucasians  (or African-Americans, as appropriate). Although there was  a degree of scatter in the longitudinal profiles, calculations  of the rate of clearance of the excess IgG indicated that the  minimal estimate for the half-life was in the range of 4&#x02013;12  wk for three individuals, and 34 wk for the fourth (no.  1008; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; see legend for individual values). </p><p>Longitudinal analyses of the changes in specific antibody  titer were also performed on members of cohort 2 (Table  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Pre- and post-therapy anti-gp120 and anti-p24  titers are recorded for each member of the cohort, along  with the extent of the decreases in each parameter during  the period of therapy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Anti-gp120 and anti-p24  titers declined in almost all individuals, but generally to  only a modest extent (median declines were approximately  threefold). The rate of decline in anti-gp120 titer was estimated for the four individuals in whom the kinetics of excess IgG clearance were also studied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The half-life  of the anti-gp120 titer reduction was 7&#x02013;21 wk, and for  those three individuals with measurable titers the half-life  of anti-p24 titer reduction was 9&#x02013;15 wk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main purpose of this study was to explore how  HIV-1&#x02013;specific and &#x02013;nonspecific B cell responses were affected by combination antiretroviral therapy. We sampled  only the peripheral blood to avoid invasive procedures, so  all conclusions we draw refer specifically to this compartment. Nonetheless, the effects of antiviral therapy on the  cells of the peripheral blood may mirror, at least qualitatively, effects on cells in other tissues, such as lymph nodes  and bone marrow.</p><p>B cell abnormalities associated with HIV-1 infection are  manifested by a significantly elevated frequency of HIV-1  antigen&#x02013;nonspecific IgG-ASCs in the peripheral blood and  by hypergammaglobulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These are probably associated phenomena in that overproduction of IgG by circulating ASCs will tend to increase plasma IgG concentrations, but they are not inevitably linked to one another.  Thus, IgG-ASC frequencies are significantly elevated in  acutely infected individuals, but without hypergammaglobulinemia, whereas both parameters are often increased during chronic infection. Overall, IgG-ASC frequency was  not correlated with plasma IgG concentration. Either circulating IgG-ASCs make a negligible contribution to total  plasma IgG, so that an increase in their frequency is inconsequential, or else there is an increase in the rate of IgG  clearance to compensate; the steady state plasma IgG concentration obviously reflects a balance between IgG production and clearance. The capacity of the IgG-clearance  mechanism(s) may, at some stage, be directly or indirectly  affected by systemic HIV-1 infection. Defects in the reticuloendothelial system associated with IgG clearance have  been reported to be a complication of advanced HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); these might contribute to hypergammaglobulinemia.</p><p>Antiviral therapy that causes substantial reductions in  HIV-1 viremia has a rapid effect on antigen-specific and  -nonspecific IgG-ASC frequencies during both acute and  chronic infection. Coincident with, or soon after, therapy-induced declines in plasma viremia, IgG-ASCs start to disappear from the blood, with a half-life of only a few weeks.  The IgG-ASC frequency then remains at low levels for  prolonged periods, provided antiviral therapy continues to  suppress HIV-1 replication. In one individual (no. 902)  who was poorly compliant with therapy, there was a rapid  rebound in the numbers of circulating IgG-ASCs. Hypergammaglobulinemia is also resolved by antiviral therapy,  with a half-life of 4&#x02013;34 wk. This was somewhat longer  than the half-life of IgG secretion from the IgG-ASC population isolated from the peripheral blood (1&#x02013;3.5 wk), but  the half-life of plasma IgG molecules (&#x0223c;3 wk in uninfected  people; 26) must also be taken into account. Even if excess  IgG production were instantly and completely stopped,  which is obviously not the case, it would still take several  weeks for a significant reduction in plasma IgG concentration  to be manifested. In practice, production of polyclonal IgG  molecules in some compartment that is not in equilibrium  with the blood is likely to be sustained for some time. Residual viral antigen production due to incompletely effective antiviral therapy could be a contributory factor here, as  could the presence of persistent antigen trapped on follicular dendritic cells. In addition, abnormally slow clearance of  IgG from plasma could, in principle, contribute to the  maintenance of high plasma IgG levels in some chronically  infected individuals (see above).</p><p>How could a reduction in HIV-1 replication decrease  the circulating IgG-ASC frequency? There are several possibilities: (<italic>a</italic>) these cells die; (<italic>b</italic>) they are redistributed to another body compartment; (<italic>c</italic>) cellular activation to secrete  IgG is directly or indirectly dependent on continued HIV-1  replication; or (<italic>d</italic>) new ASCs are not induced. We cannot  discriminate between these possibilities, but we note that  there is a correlation between the circulating IgG-ASC frequency and the level of plasma viremia before therapy.  This tends to argue against the redistribution hypothesis,  and in favor of a relationship (direct or otherwise) between  the production of HIV-1 antigens and antibody secretion  from circulating B cells. The resurgence of the IgG-ASC  frequency in no. 902 during a period of poor compliance is  also consistent with the latter theory (since no increase in  plasma viremia was detected in no. 902 during this period,  we presume that HIV-1 replication in lymphoid tissues was  responsible).</p><p>But how might HIV-1 replication affect B cell function  in vivo? HIV-1 antigen load could obviously be an influence on antigen-specific IgG-ASCs, but the majority of  circulating IgG-ASCs are not specific for HIV-1 antigens  yet are sensitive to a lowering in their concentration. Although HIV-1 has been reported to contain a superantigen(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), this is controversial and the balance of the  evidence is not compelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). HIV-1 has also been  reported to directly activate B cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and in  one study this effect was reported to be mediated by the  COOH terminus of gp41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, nonspecific activation of the immune system appears to be a phenomenon  common to many viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In particular,  simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaques is associated with a generalized activation of B as well as T cells,  leading to a significant increase in the rate of B cell turnover in infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Thus, further investigations  should not be limited to effects triggered specifically by  HIV-1 antigens. Another possibility is that HIV-1 replication in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or macrophages causes the secretion  of a cytokine such as IL-6 that activates IgG secretion from  B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and that the reduction in HIV-1 replication interrupts the production of this cytokine(s). In one  individual, we have been able to monitor changes in the  plasma IL-6 concentrations that mirror changes in plasma  viremia (Binley, J.M., and J.P. Moore, unpublished observations), but this requires further investigation.</p><p>For most individuals, there was no correlation between  circulating anti-gp120 IgG-ASC frequencies and plasma  anti-gp120 antibody titers. This is not surprising since most  specific antibody production occurs outside the blood,  probably by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), but it does expose the limitations in sampling circulating IgG-ASCs when trying to dissect the specific humoral immune response to HIV-1 infection. Antigen-specific B cell functions were also affected by antiviral therapy.  As with the nonspecific IgG-ASCs, gp120-specific IgG-ASC frequencies decreased rapidly when antiviral therapy  began, in both acutely and chronically infected individuals,  but this was not accompanied by a decrease in plasma anti-gp120 titer over the same time period. Indeed, in one  acutely infected individual (no. 902), the anti-gp120 titer  continued to increase during a period when there was a  marked decline in his circulating gp120-specific IgG-ASC  frequency. Since subject no. 902 was not hypergammaglobulinemic, the increase in his anti-gp120 antibody titer  has little to do with any defect in IgG clearance; instead, it  may reflect the continued production of anti-gp120 antibodies by plasma cells in bone marrow in a manner insensitive to  reductions in HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Alternatively, it may  be related to this individual's poor adherence to therapy.</p><p>The more prolonged therapy provided to the members  of cohort 2 was accompanied by a gradual decline in anti-gp120 and anti-p24 titers. But this decrease was usually  only modest, approximately threefold on average. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the specific titers in chronically infected people are continuing to decline, or have  stabilized at a reduced level; the present indications favor  the latter interpretation but more protracted studies are required to be sure of this. The half-lives of the anti-gp120  and anti-p24 titer declines were in the range of 7&#x02013;21 wk.  These are somewhat longer than the fall in the circulating  gp120- and p24-specific IgG-ASC frequencies, probably  for reasons similar to those discussed above in the context  of the relationship between total IgG-ASC frequency and  hypergammaglobulinemia. Although the relative rates of  decline of total IgG and HIV-1 antigen&#x02013;specific IgG differed between the four individuals, it is likely that the gradual reductions in anti-gp120 and anti-p24 titers are related  to the decrease in plasma IgG concentration, rather than to  any specific effect on HIV-1 antibody production.</p><p>Studies on the three LTNPs were particularly informative. These individuals had essentially undetectable levels of  circulating gp120-specific IgG-ASCs, yet very high titers of  anti-gp120 and anti-p24 antibodies. This is, in itself, strong  evidence that circulating IgG-ASCs make little or no contribution to the overall production of antigen-specific antibodies during HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the appearance of  large quantities of antigen-specific ASCs in the blood may  be a pathological consequence of HIV-1 replication, and an  early one at that, although perhaps of relatively benign  consequence. The aviremic individual (no. S006) and the  three LTNPs also had normal (indeed slightly subnormal)  levels of total IgG-ASCs (and also IgM-ASCs), consistent  with their normal plasma IgG concentrations. Thus, although the LTNPs have been HIV-1 infected for up to  15 yr, they show no abnormalities of B cell function.  Therefore, the latter is not an inevitable consequence of  HIV-1 infection, nor of the antibody response that is generated to HIV-1 antigens. The limited studies on individual  no. S006 (infected for only 1&#x02013;2 yr but also with undetectable  plasma viremia) indicated that his B cell&#x02013;mediated responses  were indistinguishable from those in the three LTNPs.  Thus, B cell abnormalities are associated with progressive  HIV-1 infection and the extensive viral replication that is  intimately associated with its pathology. These abnormalities are resolved by effective antiviral therapy, and the effect  is sustained while viremia remains suppressed. This seems  encouraging for the prospects of repairing at least some of  the damage to normal immune functions caused by HIV-1  infection. In addition, the reduction in B cell hyperactivity  may also result in a lowering of the incidence of B cell lymphoma during HIV-1 infection.</p></sec></body><back><sec
