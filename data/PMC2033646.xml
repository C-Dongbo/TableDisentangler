Complete remission occurred in six out of the 20 patients (30%, 95% confidence interval 12-54%) and there were 12 partial responders (60%, 95% confidence interval 37-81%), thus giving an overall response rate of 90% (95% confidence interval 63-97%). Two patients had progressive disease. The median duration of response for those patients with metastatic disease was 7.3 (1.3-20.1+) months. The median survival time for these patients was 15 (5.3-27.9+) months. Of the four patients treated with locally advanced disease three achieved a complete clinical response and one a partial response. Three out of four of these patients subsequently underwent a mastectomy, and in one of these no viable tumour was seen. Our conclusion is that this regimen is excellent palliation for metastatic disease and possibly useful neoadjuvant treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="610" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="611" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="612" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00049-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="613" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
