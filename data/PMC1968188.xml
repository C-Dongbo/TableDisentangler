After entering five patients toxicity appeared to be related to renal function, therefore the individual dose (total dose 20-100 mg m-2 over 5 days) of lobaplatin was modified according to creatinine clearance (CRCL) and escalated in patients. Twenty-seven patients with refractory solid tumours received 72 courses. Thrombocytopenia was dose-limiting, its degree was related to dose and CRCL at time of drug administration. With a CRCL of 60-80 ml min-1 the maximum tolerated dose was 40 mg m-2, with a CRCL of 81-100 ml min-1 70 mg m-2, and with a CRCL &#x0003e; 100 ml min-1 it was 85 mg m-2. Platelet and leukocyte nadirs were observed around day 21. The percentual platelet nadir (percentage of day 1 platelet count) correlated with CRCL at different dose levels and could be described by 0.76 x CRCL (ml min-1) - (1.45 x dose (mg m-2) + 43.38. This equation tested in 20 patients (28 courses) produced a correlation between observed and predicted percentual platelet nadir (r = 0.82, P &#x0003c; 0.001). No renal function impairment occurred. Urinary excretion of platinum (by A.A.S) was estimated in six patients and revealed that 91.5% (s.e. +/- 7.9) of the platinum dose was excreted within 4 h. Responses (one PR, one CR) occurred in two patients with ovarian cancer (both pretreated with carboplatin and cisplatin). The recommended dose of lobaplatin i.v. bolus daily for 5 days for phase II studies depends on renal function, namely 30 mg m-2 at CRCL 60-80 ml min-1; 55 mg m-2 at CRCL 81-100 ml min-1; 70 mg m-2 at CRCL &#x0003e; 100 ml min-1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="396" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="397" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="398" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="399" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="400" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00204-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="401" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
