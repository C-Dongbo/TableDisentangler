Subjects exposed to the SWMMC atmosphere develop several histopathological changes in their nasal mucosa: dysplasia is the most significant, affecting 78.72% of adult individuals within 60 or more days of residence in SWMMC. This study was originally designed to explore whether chemical intervention could modify nasal dysplasia, as determined by nasal cytology, in a defined adult population. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, 177 healthy male subjects were divided into 5 groups to whom 5000 IU of vitamin A, 100 IU of vitamin E, a combination of vitamins A and E (5000 IU + 100 IU), 16 mg of beta-carotene, or placebo were administered daily for 4 months. Sixteen clinical and cytological variables were monitored. No effect on dysplasia was seen at the end of the 4-month trial; however, an apparent reversibility as well as progression of the dysplastic nasal lesions and high correlation coefficients between dysplasia and nasal cytology of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; 0.85), squamous metaplasia (SM; 0.50), and nasal mucosa atrophy (NMA; 0.41) were found. A mathematical theoretical nasal dysplasia (tD) predictor equation for SWMMC adult male inhabitants is proposed (tD = 0.85 delta PMNs + 0.50 delta SM + 0.41 delta NMA + 0.98), in which PMNs are the best single dysplasia predictor, and all variables are independent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>p138-a</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0048-a" xlink:role="138"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0049-a" xlink:role="139"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>Figure 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0049-b" xlink:role="139"/></fig><fig id="F4"><label>Figure 3.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0049-c" xlink:role="139"/></fig><fig id="F5"><label>Figure 4.</label><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0050-a" xlink:role="140"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="138" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="139" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="140" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="141" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="142" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="143" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00372-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="144" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
