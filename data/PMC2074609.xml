The present study investigates 352 patients with squamous carcinoma of the head and neck treated by primary radical radiotherapy and who subsequently underwent surgical ablation for a recurrent carcinoma. A total of 303 (86%) patients had a negative resection margin and 49 (14%) had a positive resection margin. Oral carcinoma was 1.7 times more likely to be associated with a positive margin than other tumours (P = 0.0292). Actuarial calculations demonstrated that 47% of patients with negative margins and 66% of patients with positive margins developed a primary site recurrence (P = 0.0286). Neck node recurrence occurred in 10% of those patients with negative margins and 12% of patients with positive margins. Patients with positive margins had a significantly poorer survival than those with negative margins (P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis failed to confirm any independent adverse effect from a positive margin. The 5 year tumour-specific survival of patients with a positive margin was poorer by 12% than for those patients with a negative margin. The pattern of failure differed between the two groups, with patients having positive margins tending to die of local recurrence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="128" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="129" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="130" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="131" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="132" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
