The agent was administered as a monthly depot intramuscular injection. Peak levels of ICI 182780 occurred a median of 8-9 days after dosing and then declined but were above the projected therapeutic threshold at day 28. Cmax during the first month was 10.5 ng/ml-1 and during the sixth month was 12.6 ng ml-1. The AUCs were 140.5 and 206.8 ng day ml-1 on the first and sixth month of dosing respectively, suggesting some drug accumulation. Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rose after withdrawal of tamoxifen and then plateaued, suggesting no effect of ICI 182780 on the pituitary-hypothalamic axis. There were no significant changes in serum levels of prolactin, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or lipids. Side-effects were infrequent. Hot-flushes and sweats were not induced and there was no apparent effect of treatment upon the endometrium or vagina. Thirteen (69%) patients responded (seven had partial responses and six showed "no change' responses) to ICI 182780, after progression on tamoxifen, for a median duration of 25 months. Thus ICI 182780, given by monthly depot injection, and at the drug levels described, is an active second-line anti-oestrogen without apparent negative effects on the liver, brain or genital tract and warrants further evaluation in patients with advanced breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="300" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="301" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="302" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="303" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="304" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="305" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="306" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="307" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00018-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="308" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
