They received vinorelbine 25 mg m-2 i.v. given weekly for a maximum of 16 cycles. Two patients achieved a complete remission and 15 a partial remission, giving a response rate of 17/34 (50%; 95% CI of 34-66%); median response duration was 5.8 months. The median progression-free interval was 4.4 months and median survival 9.9 months. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Fatigue was the most common side-effect. The main reason for dose adjustments was myelosuppression; 68% of patients had WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and there was one death attributed to neutropenic sepsis. Nausea/vomiting and neuropathy were mild and alopecia was uncommon. This study confirms vinorelbine as a highly active, well-tolerated agent in advanced breast cancer worthy of evaluation in combination chemotherapy regimens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="990" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="991" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="992" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="993" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
