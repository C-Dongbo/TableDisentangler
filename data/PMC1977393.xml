VEEP contains vincristine, epirubicin, etoposide and prednisolone given at 3 weekly intervals. Forty-four patients, aged 2-15 years, have been treated: ten relapsed patients and 34 previously untreated with chemotherapy (including three relapsed stage I treated initially with radiotherapy). The median follow up for all patients is 25 months (range 6-52 months). The response rate in previously treated patients was 80% (95% CI 44-97%) and five remain alive in remission. The response rate in untreated patients was 88% (95% CI 72-97%) with 62% CR + CR(u) (uncertain/unconfirmed) (95% CI 44-77%). Of four patients who had a final response of CR(u) three have relapsed at 9, 16 and 38 months. Two of the children in CR have relapsed at 6 and 16 months. The relapse free rate at 3 years is 67% (95% CI 17-82%). In this pilot study the event free survival appears somewhat poorer than conventional combinations and further follow up is required to confirm the salvagability of relapsed patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0126.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="756" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="757" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="758" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="759" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="760" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
