Oxaliplatin (100&#x02008;mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was given every 2 weeks and PVI 5-FU (300&#x02008;mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was administered. Median age of patients was 61 years. 17 patients had &#x0003e;2 sites of disease involvement. 10 had received 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy. 16 received oxaliplatin and PVI 5-FU as second-line chemotherapy for advanced disease and 22 as third or subsequent lines. Median follow up was 6.1 months. The best achieved objective tumour response rate was 29&#x00025; (11 partial responses 95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI] = 15&#x02013;46&#x00025;). 20 patients (52.6&#x00025;) had stable disease. The median duration of response was 3.9 months. Even for patients who had previously received both 5-FU and irinotecan (<italic>n</italic>= 22), 27.3&#x00025; had partial response with oxaliplatin and PVI 5-FU. 37 patients had symptoms on entry into the study. 25 patients had pain, 10 had anorexia and 28 had lethargy. 64&#x00025;, 70&#x00025; and 17.9&#x00025; had symptomatic improvement after treatment respectively. Grade 3&#x02013;4 toxicities were anaemia 10.6&#x00025;, neutropenia 2.6&#x00025;, thrombocytopenia 5.2&#x00025;, diarrhoea 18.9&#x00025;, nausea and vomiting 2.7&#x00025;, infection 5.4&#x00025; and lethargy 37.8&#x00025;. The median survival was 9.1 months. Probability of overall survival at 6 months was 58.4&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI = 38.7&#x02013;73.7&#x00025;). The median failure-free survival was 4 months. Oxaliplatin and PVI 5FU is an active and well tolerated regimen in patients with heavily pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer. &#x000a9; 2001 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxaliplatin</kwd><kwd>5-fluorouracil</kwd><kwd>protracted venous infusion</kwd><kwd>colorectal carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
