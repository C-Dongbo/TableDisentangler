Twelve chemonaive patients with ovarian cancer were treated with paclitaxel followed by a 30-min infusion of carboplatin. Paclitaxel dose was escalated from 150 mg m-2 to 225 mg m-2 in cohorts of three patients. Carboplatin dose was based on renal function. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in nine patients (at least two at each dose level). A total of 66 courses were evaluable for assessment. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 70% of the courses, however hospitalization was not required. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 24% of the courses. Alopecia, myalgia and peripheral neuropathy were common but rarely severe. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel was non-linear and did not appear to be influenced by co-administration of carboplatin. The AUC of carboplatin was 7.0 +/- 1.4 mg ml-1 min, indicating that there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel may be administered as first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Although myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of the component drugs, the severity of thrombocytopenia was less than anticipated. The results of this study, with only a small number of patients, need to be confirmed in future investigations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="287" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="288" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="289" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="290" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="291" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="292" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="293" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="294" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
