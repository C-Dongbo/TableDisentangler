Various combinations of cisplatin, methotrexate, vinblastine (or vincristine) and doxorubicin were used. The complete response rate according to the WHO criteria was 17%. Partial responses were obtained in 42% of the patients. The overall cancer-related 2 year and 5 year survival rates were 21% and 11% respectively. Based on multivariate analyses, a good prognosis group could be identified comprising patients with a good performance status with disease confined to lymph nodes (14%) or patients with T4b disease only. These patients had a 28% 5 year survival rate, which, in part, has to be related to post-chemotherapy consolidation treatment in patients with pelvis-confined disease (radiotherapy, 26%; total cystectomy, 11%). Fifteen patients died of chemotherapy-related complications and in 16% of the patients toxicity led to discontinuation of treatment. Modern cisplatin-based chemotherapy leads to long-term survival and cure of selected patients with advanced urothelial transitional cancer. In routine clinical practice, chemotherapy should be offered to good prognosis patients; those presenting with a good performance status and a non-metastasising T4b tumour or with metastases confined to lymph nodes. Post-chemotherapy consolidation treatment by surgery or radiotherapy should always be considered. Such chemotherapy requires oncological expertise in order to avoid unnecessary toxicity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00026-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1655" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00026-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1656" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00026-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1657" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00026-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1658" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00026-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1659" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
