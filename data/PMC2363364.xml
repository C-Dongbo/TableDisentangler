The median age was 8.3 years. There were 81 boys and 31 girls. According to the extent of the primary disease, patients were sub-staged into three groups: IIIA with unresectable abdominal tumour (<italic>n</italic>= 39); IIIB with abdominal multiorgan involvement (<italic>n</italic>= 57) and IIIX with extra-abdominal primary lymphoma often presenting as pleural effusion (<italic>n</italic>= 16). Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to evaluate the prognostic significance of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level at diagnosis, the sub-stage and the time to achieve complete remission (CR). With a median follow up of 48 months (range 12&#x02013;92), the overall and event free survival (EFS) is 87&#x00025; (95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI) 79.2&#x02013;92.1&#x00025;) and 83.7&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI 76.3&#x02013;89.2&#x00025;) respectively. Six patients (5.4&#x00025;) never achieved CR, of whom one is alive following high-dose therapy. Eight patients (7.1&#x00025;) relapsed after achieving CR, three are alive after second-line therapy. There were three early toxic deaths (2.7&#x00025;), mainly from infection, and one late death from a second cancer. There was no significant difference in EFS according to LDH level at diagnosis, the sub-stage or the time to CR. This study confirms the overall good prognosis and low rate of toxic deaths in patients with advanced B-NHL treated with this intensive regimen. No significant difference in EFS according to the sub-stage, the time to achieve CR or LDH level at diagnosis making it difficult to identify a group that should not receive intensive therapy. &#x000a9; 2000 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>childhood</kwd><kwd>B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</kwd><kwd>advanced stage III and IV</kwd><kwd>UKCCSG 9002 protocol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
