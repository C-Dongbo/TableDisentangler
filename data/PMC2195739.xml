We used mature, monocyte-derived DCs to elicit resistance to malignant melanoma. The DCs were pulsed with Mage-3A1 tumor peptide and a recall antigen, tetanus toxoid or tuberculin. 11 far advanced stage IV melanoma patients, who were progressive despite standard chemotherapy, received five DC vaccinations at 14-d intervals. The first three vaccinations were administered into the skin, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> DCs each subcutaneously and intradermally, followed by two intravenous injections of 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> DCs, respectively. Only minor (less than or equal to grade II) side effects were observed. Immunity to the recall antigen was boosted. Significant expansions of Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors were induced in 8/11 patients. Curiously, these immune responses often declined after the intravenous vaccinations. Regressions of individual metastases (skin, lymph node, lung, and liver) were evident in 6/11 patients. Resolution of skin metastases in two of the patients was accompanied by erythema and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, whereas nonregressing lesions lacked CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as Mage-3 mRNA expression. This study proves the principle that DC &#x0201c;vaccines&#x0201d; can frequently expand tumor-specific CTLs and elicit regressions even in advanced cancer and, in addition, provides evidence for an active CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL&#x02013;tumor cell interaction in situ as well as escape by lack of tumor antigen expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>active immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic T lymphocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>It is now established that the immune system has cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs, that can recognize tumor antigens and kill tumors <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>. Nevertheless, a major problem is that these T cells are either not induced or only weakly induced, i.e., the T cells are not evident in the systemic circulation. One possibility is that there is inadequate tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), &#x0201c;nature's adjuvant&#x0201d; for eliciting T cell immunity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>. Another is that tumor-reactive T cells are tolerized by the tumors <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>. Melanoma provides a compelling setting in which to pursue a current goal of cancer immunotherapy, the generation of stronger tumor-specific T cell immunity, particularly with CTLs <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>. The majority of tumor antigens identified so far are expressed by melanomas <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>. Limited antimelanoma CTL responses have been detected <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>, and infusions of IL-2 expanded killer cells can lead to rejection of melanoma <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>.</p><p>Conventional adjuvants promote antibody rather than CTL responses. Therefore, several novel strategies are being explored to induce tumor-specific T cell immunity. DC vaccination is one of these <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>. Immature DCs capture antigens but lack full T cell&#x02013;stimulatory activity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>. In the presence of appropriate stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines, the DCs mature. DCs upregulate T cell adhesion and costimulatory molecules as well as select chemokine receptors that guide DC migration into lymphoid organs for priming of antigen-specific T cells. The use of DCs as adjuvants is supported by many animal experiments with primarily mature DCs <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. These studies have shown that the injection of tumor antigen&#x02013;loaded DCs reliably induces tumor-specific CTL responses, tumor resistance, and in some cases, regression of metastases <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. In the few pilot trials reported so far for humans, <italic>immature</italic> DCs have been employed <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>. Scattered tumor responses are reported, but evidence for the induction of tumor-specific CTLs by DC vaccination has not been shown.</p><p>We have developed a technique to generate large numbers of homogenous populations of <italic>mature</italic> and stable DCs from monocytes in the absence of nonhuman proteins <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. We are now exploring the use of these DCs as vaccine adjuvants in humans. Here we provide the proof of the principle by demonstrating that three intracutaneous injections of Mage-3A1 peptide&#x02013;pulsed mature DCs reliably enhance Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and recall CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity in heavily pretreated, progressive stage IV melanoma patients with large tumor loads. Expansions of Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTL responses have not been previously detected after Mage-3A1 peptide vaccination in less advanced melanoma patients <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>, underscoring the potent adjuvant properties of DCs. As regressions of metastases also occurred upon DC-mediated immunization and were accompanied by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration, we propose that the induced Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTLs are active in vivo.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Eligibility Criteria</title><p>Patients were eligible if they suffered from stage IV (i.e., distant metastases) cutaneous malignant melanoma (1988 American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale Contre Cancer pTNM staging system) that was not curable by resection and was progressive despite chemo(immuno)therapy.

The protocol was also approved by the ethics committees of the involved study centers.</p><p>The study design is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>. All patients gave written informed consent before undergoing a screening evaluation to determine their eligibility. Extensive clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted at visits 1, 5, and 8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>) and consisted of a complete physical examination, staging procedures, and standard laboratory values as well as special ones (pregnancy test, free testosterone in males, autoantibody profile, and antibodies to HIV-1/2, human T cell lymphotropic virus type I, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus). Patients were hospitalized and examined the day before each vaccination and were monitored for 48 h after the DC injections. Adverse events and changes in laboratory values were graded on a scale derived from the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of the DC Vaccine</title><p>During prestudy screening, we tested a small amount of fresh blood to verify that appropriate numbers of mature DCs could be generated from the patient's monocytes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. Sufficient DC numbers could be successfully generated in all patients, but in some patients the test generation revealed that TNF-&#x003b1; had to be added to assure full maturation. To avoid repetitive blood drawings, we performed a single leukapheresis during visit 2 to generate DCs as described <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. In short, PBMCs from the leukapheresis (&#x02265;10<sup>10</sup> nucleated cells) were isolated on Lymphoprep&#x02122; (Nycomed Pharma) and divided into three fractions. The first fraction of 10<sup>9</sup> PBMCs was cultured on bacteriological petri dishes (Cat. #1005&#x0003b; Falcon Labware) coated with human Ig (100 &#x003bc;g/ml&#x0003b; Sandoglobin&#x02122;&#x0003b; Sandoz GmbH) in complete RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 20 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin (Refobacin 10&#x0003b; Merck), 2 mM glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 1% heat-inactivated human plasma for 24 h to generate monocyte-conditioned medium (MCM) for later use as the DC maturation stimulus. The second fraction of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> PBMCs was used for the generation of DCs for vaccination 1 and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test I. Adherent monocytes were cultured in 1,000 U/ml GM-CSF (10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> U/mg&#x0003b; Leukomax&#x02122;&#x0003b; Novartis) and 800 U/ml IL-4 (purity &#x0003e;98%&#x0003b; 4.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> U/mg in a bioassay using proliferation of human IL-4R<sup>+</sup> CTLL&#x0003b; CellGenix&#x0003b; expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and produced under good laboratory practice conditions but verified for good manufacturing practice [GMP] safety and purity criteria by us) for 6 d, and then MCM was added to mature the DCs.

The third fraction of PBMCs was frozen in aliquots and stored in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen to generate DCs for later vaccinations and DTH tests.</p><p>DCs for vaccinations were pulsed with the Mage-3A1 peptide <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> (EVDPIGHLY, synthesized at GMP quality by Clinalfa) as tumor antigen, and as a recall antigen and positive control, tetanus toxoid (TT) or tuberculin (if at visit 1 the DTH to TT in the Multitest Merieux was &#x0003e;10 mm&#x0003b; both purchased from the Bacterial Vaccines Department of the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). The recall antigen was added at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml for the last 24 h, and the Mage-3A1 peptide was added at 10 &#x003bc;M directly to the cultures for the last 8 h (if immunity to recall antigens was strongly boosted, the dose of recall antigen was reduced to 1.0 or 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml or was omitted for the intravenous DC injections to avoid a cytokine release syndrome). On day 7, mature DCs were harvested, resuspended in complete medium, washed, and pulsed once more with Mage-3A1 peptide (now at 30 &#x003bc;M) for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C. DCs were finally washed and resuspended in PBS (GMP quality PBS&#x0003b; BioWhittaker) for injection. DCs to be used for Mage-3A1 DTH tests were pulsed with Mage-3A1 (but no recall antigen)&#x0003b; DCs that served as negative control in the DTH tests were not pulsed at all. An aliquot of the DCs to be used for vaccinations was analyzed as described <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref> to assure that functionally active and mature DCs were generated.

For vaccinations 1&#x02013;3, 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> DCs were given subcutaneously at two sites (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> DCs in 500 &#x003bc;l PBS per site) and 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> intradermally at 10 sites (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> DCs in 100 &#x003bc;l PBS per site). The injection sites were the ventromedial regions of the upper arms and the thighs close to the regional lymph nodes and were rotated clockwise.

For intravenous vaccinations 4 and 5, a total of 6 and 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> antigen-pulsed DCs (resuspended in 25 or 50 ml PBS plus 1% autologous plasma) was administered over 5 and 10 min, respectively.

Elevation of body temperature (grade I and II fever) was observed in most (9/11) patients and was also related to pulsing DCs with recall antigen. The most striking example was patient 02, who progressively developed fever (up to 40&#x000b0;C) upon successive vaccinations but did not show a rise in body temperature when TT was omitted for the final (fifth) vaccination. We observed slight lymph node enlargement, clinically in 63% and by sonography in 83% of patients, after the intracutaneous DC injections. Interestingly, these were delayed, being inapparent during the 2 d of monitoring after vaccinations but detected when patients were investigated again the day before the next vaccination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunological Responses</title><sec><title>Boosting of Recall Antigen-specific Immunity.</title><p>PBMCs that had been frozen before vaccination and 14 d after vaccination 5 were thawed and assayed together, as specified in the protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>).

Supernatants from the proliferative assays contained large amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; (mean 1,679 pg/ml, range 846&#x02013;4,325) but little IL-4 (IFN-&#x003b3;/IL-4, 317:1). In five patients, we studied the kinetics of the immune response to TT by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT analysis. We found an increase after the intracutaneous vaccinations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) but a peculiar decrease after the intravenous vaccinations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.008&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, comparing recall immunity before and after all five vaccinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) as prespecified in the protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>) obviously underestimated the extent of boosting.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion of Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTLp.</title><p>Aliquots of PBMCs, frozen before the first and after the third and fifth vaccinations, were thawed at the same time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table </xref>) and subjected to a semiquantitative recall assay for CTLp (reference 17&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

Remarkably, significant infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not found in any of these lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In deciding on the source of DCs for this phase I trial, we selected <italic>mature</italic>, monocyte-derived DCs for the following reasons. Monocyte-derived DCs currently represent the most homogenous and potent DC populations, with several defining criteria and quality controls <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. The method for generating production of these DCs is very reproducible and allows the cryopreservation of large numbers of cells at an identical stage of development <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. Furthermore, these DCs can be produced in the absence of potentially hazardous FCS <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. FCS exposure also leads to large syngeneic T cell responses in culture, so their clinical use <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> might produce nonspecific immunostimulatory effects. Unlike other investigators <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>, we chose to use mature rather than immature DCs for our first melanoma trial. The DCs that have been used with efficacy in animal experiments were primarily mature <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. Mature DCs are much more potent in inducing CTL and Th1 responses in vitro (reference <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref> and Jonuleit, H., A. Gieseke, A. Kandemir, L. Paragnik, J. Knop, and A.H. Enk, manuscript in preparation), and the DCs are also resistant to the immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref> that can be produced by tumors <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. Mature DCs also display an extended half-life of antigen-presenting MHC class I <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26a">26a</xref> and class II molecules <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>. Finally, mature DCs have a high migratory activity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref> and express CCR7 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>, a receptor for chemokines produced constitutively in lymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>. Mature DCs, as used in this cancer therapy trial, have recently also been shown to rapidly generate broad T cell immunity in healthy subjects <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>.</p><p>Mature DCs were loaded with only one melanoma peptide, Mage-3A1, to avoid uncertainties regarding loading of DCs with multiple peptides <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> of varying affinity and off rate. Successful loading was verified with a Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTL clone and ELISPOT analysis (not shown). The Mage-3A1 peptide <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> was selected for several reasons. It is essentially tumor specific <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref> and expressed in tumors other than melanoma <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>, and the Mage-3A1 epitope is likely a rejection antigen <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. Moreover, the Mage-3A1 CTLp frequency is exceedingly low in noncancer patients (reference 18&#x0003b; 0.4&#x02013;3 per 10<sup>7</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) as well as in cancer patients, even after peptide vaccination <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. Thus, any induction or boost of Mage-3A1 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses would indicate a significant superiority in the adjuvant capacities of DCs.</p><p>DTH assays with peptide-pulsed DCs were carried out as described by Nestle et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> to detect Mage-3A1 immunity (not shown). However, we did not detect unequivocal DTH. This was due to the frequently observed background to nonpulsed DCs (possibly due to cytokine production by DCs) and the noteworthy variability from test site to test site. As Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific T cells are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and DTH assays typically detect primed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we suspect that DTH to MHC class I peptide&#x02013;pulsed DCs may also for this reason prove not to be a sensitive or reliable way to monitor specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated immunity.</p><p>In contrast, we found sizable expansions of Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTL precursors in PBMCs from a majority (8/11) of patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.008&#x0003b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This is an important proof of the principle of DC-based immunization, and it is also significant from the point of view that tumors can induce tolerance or anergy. It is very promising that CTLp expansions can be induced in far advanced and heavily pretreated stage IV melanoma patients. However, active Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific effectors were generally not observed in ELISPOT assays, except for in two patients with high frequencies (&#x0003e;5,000/10<sup>7</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). Perhaps active CD8<sup>+</sup> effectors were rapidly sequestered in the numerous metastases, as suggested by the biopsy studies illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. An alternative explanation is that looking for effectors in peripheral blood 14 d after a preceding vaccination might simply be too late.</p><p>Interestingly, in six patients, CTLp had increased to their highest levels after the three intracutaneous vaccinations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0013) and then decreased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.026) with subsequent intravenous immunizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The decrease in CTLp might be due to emigration of activated Mage-3&#x02013;reactive CTLs into tissues, tolerance induction, or clonal exhaustion via the intravenous route. We also observed decreased responses to recall antigens in the five patients that we studied before and after intravenous vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The effect of the intravenous route requires additional study, as it may be counterproductive. In contrast, our results clearly demonstrate that the intracutaneous route is effective, so that the less practical intranodal injection propagated by other investigators <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> does not seem essential. It will, however, be necessary to compare subcutaneous and intradermal routes to find out if one is superior.</p><p>We found regression of individual metastases in 6/11 patients when patients were staged 14 d after the fifth vaccination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>). This percentage of responses was unexpected in far advanced stage IV melanoma patients who were <italic>all</italic> progressive despite standard chemotherapy and even chemoimmunotherapy. In the study by Nestle et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>, chemotherapy was only given to 4/16 melanoma patients, and objective tumor responses were observed in 5/16. Therefore, we attribute the regressions to DC-mediated induction of Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTLs. This interpretation is supported by the heavy infiltration with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of regressing but not nonregressing (skin) metastases. The observation that all of the metastases in patients 06 and 08 that were excised at the end of the study were Mage-3 mRNA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (whereas those removed at the onset were uniformly positive) suggests immune escape of and selection for Mage-3 antigen&#x02013;negative tumors. Immune escape might also have been responsible for the lack of tumor response in those nonresponders that had mounted a Mage-3A1&#x02013;specific CTL response.</p><p>After the end of the trial, surviving patients received further vaccinations with DCs and several tumor peptides (Mage-1, tyrosinase, and Mage-3) that were no longer part of the protocol. It is encouraging that 5/11 patients are still alive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table </xref>) 9&#x02013;17 mo after study entry, as the expected median survival in patients progressive after chemo(immuno)therapy is only 4 mo <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>. One of the initial responders (patient 06) has recently experienced a complete response and has now been disease free for 2 mo. It is interesting that Marchand et al. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref> have also observed that regressions, once they have started, proceed slowly and may take months to complete.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of a defined DC vaccine combined with detailed immunomonitoring provides proof that vaccination with mature DCs expands tumor-specific T cells in advanced melanoma patients. In addition, we have found some evidence for the direct interaction between CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs and tumor cells as well as for escape of antigen-negative metastases. We are convinced that DC-mediated immunization can be intensified further to reveal the presence of expanded populations of effector cells. Efficacy might be increased at the level of the DC, e.g., by optimizing variables such as DC maturational state, route, dose, and schedule or by improving the short life span of DCs in vivo <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R32">32</xref>&#x0003b; at the level of the T cell, e.g., by providing melanoma-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bib" rid="R34">34</xref> or IL-2 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R35">35</xref>&#x0003b; and by treating patients earlier in their disease course.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all patients for their confidence and cooperation.
