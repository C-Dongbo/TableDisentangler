As both drugs were known to be potentially neurotoxic, peripheral neurotoxicity was prospectively assessed in detail. Neuropathy was evaluated by clinical sum-score for signs and symptoms and by measurement of the vibration perception threshold (VPT). The severity of neuropathy was graded according to the National Cancer Institute's 'Common Toxicity Criteria'. The docetaxel-cisplatin combination chemotherapy induced a predominantly sensory neuropathy in 29 (53%) out of 55 evaluable patients. At cumulative doses of both cisplatin and docetaxel above 200 mg m(-2), 26 (74%) out of 35 patients developed a neuropathy which was mild in 15, moderate in ten and severe in one patient. Significant correlations were present between both the cumulative dose of docetaxel and cisplatin and the post-treatment sum-score of neuropathy (P &#x0003c; 0.01) as well as the post-treatment VPT (P &#x0003c; 0.01). The neurotoxic effects of this combination were more severe than either cisplatin or docetaxel as single agent at similar doses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="417" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="418" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="419" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="420" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="421" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00180-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="422" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
