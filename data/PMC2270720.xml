		<p>
			<italic>Background</italic>: There are several mechanisms to describe allergic drug 
            reactions yet the methods to diagnose them are limited.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Objective</italic>: To compare several conventional clinical and laboratory 
            methods to diagnose skin reactions to drugs 
            to a new method of diagnosing drug reactions by the CellScan system.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Methods</italic>: The study entailed 21 patients who were diagnosed as 
            suffering from drug eruptions, and 105 healthy controls with no history of drug 
            allergy. The drugs were classified into two groups according to suspicion of 
            causing drug allergy: high and low. Most of the patients were on more than 
            one drug, leading to 41 patient-drug interactions (assays). Histamine 
            releasing test (HRT), interferon (INF)-&#x003b3; releasing test and CellScan 
            examination were performed on lymphocytes of the patients and controls.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Results</italic>: The HRT was interpreted as positive in 9 out of 18 (50%) 
            patients and in 13 out of 35 (37%) assays. Based on the INF-&#x003b3; releasing test, 
            positive results were observed in 16 out of 21 (76%) patients and in 24 out of 41 
            (59%) assays. In the CellScan test (CST), positive results were observed in 17 
            out of 21 (81%) patients and in 29 out of 41 (71%) assays. The rate of identifying 
            the drug for eruption in the high suspicion level drugs was 9 out of 22 (41%) 
            assays in the HRT, 20 out of 24 (83%) assays in the INF-&#x003b3; releasing test, and 21 
            out of 24 (87%) studies with the CellScan method. The rate of determining of 
            the drug that caused the eruption in the low suspicion level drugs was 4 out of 
            13 (31%) in the HRT, 4 out of 17 (24%) assays in the INF-&#x003b3; releasing test, and 8 
            out of 17 (47%) analyses in the CST. When examined 
            in the CellScan, 99 out of 105 (94%) controls were interpreted as negative.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Conclusion</italic>: This preliminary study indicates that the CellScan seems to 
            be an easy and promising method for the detection of drugs responsible for 
            adverse skin reactions. In contrast to the HRT and to the Interferon-&#x003b3; secretion 
            test, the CellScan method is characterized by its ability to track and monitor 
            the reaction of individual cells. By measuring the kinetic parameters of selected 
            cells before and after adding the suspected drug, we were able to identify 
            the culprit drug. The CellScan method had the highest sensitivity, and the 
            interferon-&#x003b3; secretion test had the highest specificity for detection of the culprit 
            drug. In contrast, the analysis of 105 
            normal control sera disclosed a high specificity of 94% for the CellScan method.</p>
