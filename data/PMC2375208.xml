Patients received chemotherapy (mitomycin-C: 8&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, vinblastine: 6&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, cisplatin 50&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) on a 3-weekly basis for up to six courses. IP SRL172 injections were given 3-weekly prior to chemotherapy and escalated in groups of three patients from 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g to 1&#x02009;mg bacilli in 10-fold increments. Patients were also given ID SRL172 at a dose of 1&#x02009;mg bacilli 4-weekly. Patients were assessed for toxicity after each course of chemotherapy and for response by CT imaging. Immuno-haematological parameters were analyzed pre-treatment and 1 month after completion of treatment. There was no dose limiting toxicity with IP SRL172 although there was greater toxicity at the highest dose (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13). There were six out of 16 partial responses (37.5&#x00025;). Haemato-immunological parameters, measured in seven patients pre and post-therapy, revealed that response rate correlated with a decrease in platelet count and there was an increase in activation of natural killer cells and a decrease in the percentage of IL-4 producing T cells in all tested patients post-treatment. SRL172 can be given safely into tumour deposits and the pleural cavity in patients with malignant mesothelioma and we have established the dose for phase II testing.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>86</bold>, 336&#x02013;341.

This increase is due to asbestos exposure which continued into the late 1960s. The median survival from the time of diagnosis is 4&#x02013;18 months with 5&#x00025; of patients alive at 5 years. The factors which predict for poor outcome are male sex, performance status, non epithelial pathology, low haemoglobin, high white cell count and high platelet count (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Curran <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Herndon <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). No single treatment modality appears to make a significant difference to the outcome of this disease (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Ong and Vogelzang, 1996</xref>). There is therefore a great need for improved treatment in mesothelioma. Currently we use a combination chemotherapy, mitomycin, cisplatin and vinblastine (MVP), which has been shown to lead to symptomatic control and acceptable toxicity in patients with malignant mesothelioma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Middleton <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). With this chemotherapy regimen, we expect objective response rates of around 20&#x00025;.</p><p>SRL172 is a suspension of heat-killed <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic>, a fast growing avirulent mycobacterium, that may have non-specific immunomodulating properties, e.g. it may promote Th1 and down regulate Th2 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Grange <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). The proposed rationale behind the combination was that the chemotherapy, although slightly immunosuppressive, could cause the <italic>in vivo</italic> release and subsequent presentation of tumour antigens and trigger a tumour specific response by the immune system when boosted by an immuno-modulator like SRL172. Previously we have investigated the role of intradermal SRL172 (4-weekly) in combination with MVP chemotherapy (3-weekly) in a randomized phase II trial of 28 symptomatic patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. There was a trend towards improved response rate (54&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 33&#x00025;), improved median survival (9.7 months <italic>vs</italic> 7.5 months) and improved 1 year survival (42&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 18&#x00025;) in patients who received both chemotherapy and SRL172 compared to those in the chemotherapy alone group. When the data were analyzed separately for NSCLC and for mesothelioma, the potential benefit of the combination was seen in both cancers (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">O'Brien <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). We have also reported similar results in SCLC (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Assersohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this study, intrapleural/intratumoural SRL172 injections were added to intradermal SRL172 and chemotherapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma. The rationale behind this new study was that SRL172 in the tumour or in the pleural cavity could result in an increased concentration of the immunologically active compound in the vicinity of the tumour, thus causing an inflammatory reaction which could potentiate the anti-tumour killing at the tumour site. Indeed, it has been reported that the local tumour environment of malignant mesothelioma is immunologically suppressive, due to the secretion of cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Fitzpatrick <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Marzo <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Therefore changing this local immuno-suppressive environment to a more immuno-stimulating environment may be beneficial. SRL172 had not been administered previously in the pleural cavity, and thus we initiated a phase I/II clinical trial to document the safety and clinical efficacy of repeated injections of intratumoral/intrapleural SRL172 in patients, with doses ranging from 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g to 1&#x02009;mg of <italic>M. vaccae</italic> bacilli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Selection of patients</title><p>Intrapleural (IP) and intradermal (ID) SRL172 and chemotherapy were offered to symptomatic patients of performance status 2 and above with either a histological or cytological diagnosis of mesothelioma. Patients were recruited in four cohorts corresponding to increasing doses of IP SRL172. Baseline scans were analyzed and a site for a single IP SRL172 injection was chosen aiming for the greatest area of bulk noting the proximity of vital structures and depth of the chest wall at that point. If the disease was complicated by a large pleural effusion, this was drained prior to insertion of SRL172 into the cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>SRL172 suspension</title><p>SRL172 was formulated as a suspension of 10&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> heat-killed (autoclaved at 121&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;min) <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic> in borate buffered saline (pH&#x02009;8) and was provided in 3&#x02009;ml glass vials at a concentration of 10<sup>9</sup> bacilli per 0.1&#x02009;ml dose (1&#x02009;mg) and stored refrigerated in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C in the hospital pharmacy until use.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment schedule</title><p>All patients received 3-weekly chemotherapy consisting of mitomycin-C (8&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, omitted courses 3 and 5), vinblastine 6&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (maximum 10&#x02009;mg) and cisplatin 50&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. All patients also received an intradermal injection of SRL172 (1&#x02009;mg bacilli) 4-weekly, starting at the same time as the chemotherapy. SRL172 IP injections were given 3-weekly. The IP dose of SRL172 increased tenfold with each cohort vaccine starting at 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g bacilli (cohort 1), to 1&#x02009;mg bacilli in the last cohort (cohort 4). The first IP SRL172 injection was given into the site of bulkiest disease or into the pleural cavity, at the same time as the first chemotherapy and the first intradermal injection of SRL172. Only when two patients had safely received the SRL172 for two courses could the next cohort commence treatment. Dexamethasone was omitted as an antiemetic during the first course of chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of toxicity, objective and symptomatic response</title><p>Toxicity was assessed after each cycle of chemotherapy using CTC toxicity grading.

As part of the protocol, for each patient, baseline blood was also taken from the spouse and from an age-sex-matched control. Paired blood samples were not taken in nine patients because they had either received prior chemotherapy, they refused to have blood taken for the immunological study, there was no suitable available control(s) at the time or they died before the end of the treatment. All assays were performed with whole blood requiring only 3.5&#x02009;ml of blood per patient. Full blood count and differential counts were performed in a Coulter STKS machine in the Department of Haematology. Three colour Facscan analysis of lymphocytes markers were performed as described (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Bromelow <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) and covered both T cell and NK markers.

The higher than expected number of partial responses seen (six out of nine) in the first three cohorts of this study, with toxicity similar to that seen with chemotherapy suggests that there may be an advantage to the addition of local treatment to systemic treatment in the management of this disease.</p><p>We found that most patients after chemotherapy had a decrease in platelet count, however five out of six of the patients who had a documented PR by either WHO or RECIST criteria had at least a 30&#x00025; decrease in the platelet count 1 month after their final chemotherapy compared to none out of three of patients with PD. The numbers are small and therefore the platelet count has to be formally evaluated in future large studies as a marker of this nature would have great practical implications in the assessment of response to treatment in this disease in which CT scan assessment is both difficult and resource intensive. Interleukin 6 has been implicated as one of the possible soluble factors responsible for the increase in platelet count seen in mesothelioma patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Nakano <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). It is possible that treatment decreases interleukin 6 produced by the mesothelioma with a resulting decrease in the platelet count. As previously shown, high initial platelet load is an adverse prognostic factor in this disease (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Herndon <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy are not new in the treatment of mesothelioma. Cisplatin used with subcutaneous &#x003b1;-interferon at two different doses (3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;IU and 6&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;IU) gave a response rate of 40 and 27&#x00025; in 26 and 30 patients respectively but with significant haematological and non-haematological toxicity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Soulie <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Trandafir <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). A reduced dose of cisplatin with mitomycin-C and &#x003b1;-interferon gave a response rate of 21&#x00025; in 24 patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Rodier <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The immunological testing in this study was essentially to screen different immunological parameters which may have been modified by the treatment and could in future studies lead to clarification of the mechanisms of action of the regimen. At this stage, we only included immunological parameters of T cell immunity (both Th1 and Th2 arms) and parameters of adaptive immunity (NK cells) following on from the hypothesis that SRL172 could be a non-specific immune modulator. SRL172 has been reported to increase interleulin 2 (IL-2) production in peripheral blood monocytes in patients with melanoma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Maraveyas <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) and we had also demonstrated that it leads to NK activation <italic>in vitro</italic> (KV Bromelow <italic>et al</italic>, in preparation). The immunological testing was only performed in the peripheral blood and future studies looking at possible immunological changes in the tumour are warranted. Local stimulation in itself may have a role in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma as in general this disease is localized for most of its history. We were unable to demonstrate increased IL-2 production by peripheral T cells (Th1) in this population of patients following treatment but local (intratumoural) production of cytokines is a possibility which should be tested in the future. IL-2 has been given into the pleura of patients with mesothelioma with some activity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Eggermont <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). The responses were seen at the lower dose level and IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor were not detectable in the serum. On the other hand, a significant decrease in the proportion of IL-4 producing CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (Th2) as well as an increase in NK activation was recorded in the peripheral blood after SRL172 and chemotherapy irrespective of the clinical response. At this stage we cannot say if these measurable biological modifications are due to SRL172, chemotherapy or both. However, these changes may have some direct correlation with response as it is possible that only a proportion of tumours are susceptible, for example, to NK cells (in the same way only a proportion of patients respond to chemotherapy despite all receiving the chemotherapy). Therefore possible tumour infiltration by NK cells and cytokine-producing CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells need to be studied in patients with mesothelioma who receive the regimen tested in this study.</p><p>The past 10 years have seen the arrival of a number of new drugs for the treatment of a number of solid tumours and in particular non-small cell lung cancer. Many of these new agents have now been tested in the treatment of mesothelioma both as single agents and in combination with cisplatin with different response rates (RR), e.g. Vinorelbine as single agent gave 24&#x00025; RR in 29 patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Steele <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), paclitaxel with cisplatin gave 6&#x00025; RR in 18 patients (Caliandro <italic>et al</italic>, 2000) and gemcitabine and cisplatin gave 47&#x00025; RR in 21 patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Byrne <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The survival curves in this study are very similar to our own study. Another promising drug is oxaliplatin (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Ducreux <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) which, when combined with raltitrexed, gave a RR of 41&#x00025; in 17 patients and was well tolerated as an out-patient regimen (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Fizazi <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The activity of single agent raltitrexed is under investigation by the EORTC and the antimetabolite MTA (multitargeted antifolate), which also gave encouraging results in the phase I study (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib27">Thodtmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), is currently in phase III testing. There are also some promising phase II data using docetaxel which gave a 23&#x00025; RR in a group of 22 patients when given at a dose of 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib29">Vorobiof <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Thus for the first time we are faced with a number of potentially active palliative treatments for mesothelioma but the best choice and the integration of these treatments into current management strategies awaits the initiation and completion of phase III studies. We feel the results from the study show that giving doses of SRL172 at 10<sup>7</sup> bacilli per 0.1&#x02009;ml dose (1&#x02009;mg) IP is safe and thus this should be the dose used for phase II/III studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Research Grant from SR Pharma.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
