Thirty-five eligible patients received mitoxantrone 12 mg m-2 i.v. every 3 weeks. Among 18 previously untreated patients, three responded (17%, 95% CI = 4-41%); no responses were achieved in 17 previously treated patients. Of the 21 patients who had carcinoid tumours, 11 were previously untreated and two achieved a response (18%, 95% CI = 2-52%). Overall response rate was 9% (95% CI = 2-23%). At a median follow-up of 43 months, median overall survival was 16 months. The median survival of 21 patients with a normal alkaline phosphatase was 29 months and 9 months for 14 patients with elevated serum levels (P = 0.005). A similar observation was noticed for gamma-glutamyltransferase (P = 0.007). We concluded that mitoxantrone is not active in APUD tumours. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase are associated with a poor prognosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00047-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="106" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00047-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="107" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00047-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="108" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
