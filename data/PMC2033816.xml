Unlike other studies, only patients who had demonstrably progressive disease on platinum therapy were analysed. Patients received 135-200 mg m-2 of Taxol over 3 or 24 h and all patients were assessed for response by computerised axial tomography. The overall response rate was 22.2% (8/36 patients, 95% CI 10-39%). Only patients who received &#x0003e; or = 175 mg m-2 of Taxol responded (26.7%; 8/30 patients, 95% CI 12-46%). No complete responses were seen and the duration of response was short, median 7 months (range 5-9+). Response was associated with a short treatment-free interval (P = 0.02); only those who were treated immediately after they had progressed on their previous platinum therapy responded. Response duration was associated with a good performance status (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Platinum and Taxol are non-cross-resistant in a proportion of patients and therefore patients who are resistant to platinum compounds may benefit from Taxol although the duration of any response is short. These data support current strategies that involve combining Taxol with platinum compounds as first-line therapy in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1308" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1309" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00052-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1310" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
