Histopathologically 208 patients had low-grade disease and 243 patients high-grade disease. The complete remission (CR) rate was higher in patients with low-grade disease (98%) than in those with high-grade disease (84%) (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). The relapse rate was similar in both histological categories, and relapse usually occurred within 5 years. The resulting overall actuarial percentage of patients achieving CR and remaining disease free (at 10 years) was 47% in patients with low-grade disease and 45% for those with high-grade disease. Salvage therapy was frequently successful in younger patients, and the overall cause-specific survival at 10 years was 71% for low-grade disease and 67% for high-grade disease. In those patients under 60 years of age at diagnosis, the overall cause-specific survival at 10 years was 84% and 80% for those with low-grade and high-grade disease respectively. These long-term results in young patients with clinical stage 1 disease are encouraging, and it will be difficult to demonstrate improved survival with initial chemotherapy either with or without radiotherapy, until new prognostic factors are found to identify poor-risk patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1088" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1089" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1090" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1091" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1092" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00196-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1093" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
