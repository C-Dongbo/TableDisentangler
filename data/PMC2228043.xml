The additional photodynamic treatment was performed with light of 652 nm from a high power diode laser, and meta-tetrahydroxy phenylchlorin as the photosensitizer. The light delivery to the thoracic cavity was monitored by in situ isotropic light detectors. The position of the light delivery fibre was adjusted to achieve optimal light distribution, taking account of reflected and scattered light in this hollow cavity. There was no 30-day post-operative mortality and only one patient suffered from a major complication (diaphragmatic rupture and haematopericardium). The operation time was increased by a maximum of 1 h to illuminate the total hemithoracic surface with 10 J cm(-2) (incident and scattered light). The effect of the adjuvant PDT was monitored by examination of biopsies taken 24 h after surgery under thoracoscopic guidance. Significant damage, including necrosis, was observed in the marker lesions with remaining malignancy compared with normal tissue samples, which showed only an infiltration with PMN cells and oedema of the striated muscles cells. Of the five patients treated, four are alive with no signs of recurrent tumour with a follow-up of 9-11 months. One patient was diagnosed as having a tumour dissemination in the skin around the thoracoscopy scar and died of abdominal tumour spread. Light delivery to large surfaces for adjuvant PDT is feasible in a relatively short period of time (&#x0003c; 1 h). In situ dosimetry ensures optimal light distribution and allows total doses (incident plus scattered light) to be monitored at different positions within the cavity. This combination of light delivery and dosimetry is well suited for adjuvant treatment with PDT in malignant pleural tumours.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0137-a" xlink:role="821"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 4</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0140-a" xlink:role="824"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="819" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="820" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="821" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="822" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="823" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="824" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="825" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00170-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="826" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
