Four patients without macroscopic residual disease after biopsy received three cycles of hybrid EVAP/ABV. All remain in CR 31-46 months from diagnosis. One other developed fever and rash considered to be due to Ara-C and was treated with MOPP. Twenty patients had macroscopic residual disease after biopsy and were treated with two cycles of EVAP alone and reassessed with imaging and gallium scans. Twelve achieved CR, seven PR and one was not evaluable. Patients in CR were subsequently treated with 2-4 cycles of hybrid EVAP/ABV, while those in PR received 3-4 cycles. At a median follow up of 37 months the overall survival was 100%, relapse free 79% and treatment failure free 60%. Eight patients had mediastinal widening &#x0003e; 1/3 thoracic width. At the completion of the protocol five achieved CR, two PR and one was withdrawn from study at investigator preference. One patient has subsequently relapsed. Of the evaluable ten patients without a mediastinal presentation all achieved CR but three relapsed at 10, 13 and 18 months from diagnosis. Patients who achieved a PR only, relapsed or were withdrawn from study have been salvaged with MOPP or Ch1VPP chemotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="159" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="160" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="161" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="162" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
