Sera obtained from the blood of steel welders (Delaware) and from workers of the Centra Ni-Cd Battery Factory (Pozna&#x00144;, Poland) were analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To determine specific and nonspecific binding, an oxidized thymidine [5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (HMdU)] coupled to bovine serum albumin (HMdU-BSA) as well as mock-coupled BSA (M-BSA) were used as antigens for coating the wells of microtiter plates. Titers of anti-HMdU Ab were significantly elevated in the high Cd and Ni exposure groups (18.3 +/- 3.2 vs 10.8 +/- 2.1 A492/microliters; p &#x0003c; 0.05). The sera of the groups with low exposures to Cd and Ni also had enhanced titers of those Ab but those increases were not statistically significant. Interestingly, the Ab titers present in the sera of controls for Cd and Ni exposures appear to be constant regardless of the protein content. In contrast, both lightly and heavily exposed subjects exhibited Ab titers that increased with increasing protein content. When 12 randomly selected workers (4 from each of the control, lightly, and heavily exposed groups) were outfitted with personal monitors, anti-HMdU Ab titers of those workers showed a significant difference between the groups with light (&#x0003c; 100 micrograms/m3) and heavy (&#x0003e; 200 micrograms/m3) exposures to Cd (9.8 +/- 3.7 vs 22.1 +/- 3.7 A492/microliters; p &#x0003c; 0.01) and Ni (11.7 +/- 1.4 vs 31.0 +/- 1.8; p &#x0003c; 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00399-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="221" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00399-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="222" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00399-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="223" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00399-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="224" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00399-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="225" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
