A total of 20 patients (median age 6.5 years) were treated with an infusion of verapamil (loading dose 0.1 mg kg-1, followed by continuous infusion 0.15 mg kg-1 h-1) for 72 h. Etoposide was given daily (150 mg m-2 day-1) for three doses (each over 1 h); the first dose was given 12 h into the verapamil infusion. Cardiovascular toxicity was monitored by ECG and 2 hourly blood pressure and pulse recordings. Verapamil and norverapamil plasma concentrations were measured daily. Disease response was assessed after two courses. A total of 29/35 treatment courses were given at the desired verapamil dose; five courses required a dose reduction owing to cardiovascular toxicity. No patient required intensive monitoring. All patients who developed cardiovascular toxicity were over 14 years old. There was no correlation between plasma verapamil or norverapamil concentrations and toxicity. There were six partial responses (three rhabdomyosarcoma, three neuroblastoma) after two courses, but because of variation in the dose and schedule of etoposide these cannot be unequivocally contributed to MDR reversal. In conclusion, a regimen using a continuous infusion of verapamil combined with divided-dose etoposide is tolerable in children, and this strategy may be effective in refractory neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="877" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0226.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="878" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0227.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="879" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="880" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00050-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="881" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
