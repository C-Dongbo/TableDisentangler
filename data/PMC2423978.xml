            <p>Hydatid disease of the liver is still a major cause of
morbidity in Greece. Beside the common complications
of rupture and suppuration, calcification of the
hepatic cysts represent a not well studied, less frequent
and sometimes difficult surgical problem. In
the present study 75 cases with calcified symptomatic
liver echinococcosis were operated on in the
1st Propedeutic Surgical Clinic between 1964 to
1996. Twenty-eight patients were male and 47 female
with ages from 23 to 78 years. The diagnosis was
based mainly on the clinical picture and radiological
studies. In 5 cases the operative method was
cystopericystectomy. We performed evacuation of
the cystic cavity and partial pericystectomy and
primary closure of the residual cavity in 6 cases,
omentoplasty or filling of the residual cavity with a
piece of muscle of the diaphragm in 4 cases and
external drainage by closed tube, in 60 cases. In 12 of
those with drainage, after a period of time, a second
operation with easy, removal of most of the calcareous
wall plaques was performed. The mortality rate
was 2%.</p>
<p>Our results could be considered satisfactory. In
the calcified parasitic cysts of the liver the proposed
technique is cystopericystectomy. An alternative
procedure is pericystectomy and drainage with
a &#x0201c;planned&#x0201d; reoperation with a bloodless, due
to intervening inflammation, chiseling of the
calcification.</p>
