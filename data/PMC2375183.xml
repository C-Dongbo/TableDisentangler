Measurements were performed by immunoradiometric assay which utilizes monoclonal and polyclonal anti-prostate-specific antigen antibodies; the lowest detection level for both markers was 0.01&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Free prostate-specific antigen levels were significantly higher in women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.006). The percentage of free prostate-specific antigen predominant (free prostate-specific antigen/total prostate-specific antigen &#x0003e;50&#x00025;) subjects was 20&#x00025; in colorectal carcinoma patients and 3.3&#x00025; in healthy women (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.035). Cut-off values were 0.34&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for total prostate-specific antigen and 0.01&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for free prostate-specific antigen. In women with colorectal carcinoma, total prostate-specific antigen positivity was 20&#x00025; and free prostate-specific antigen positivity was 34.6&#x00025;. When compared to negatives, total prostate-specific antigen positive patients had a lower percentage of well-differentiated (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.056) and early stage (stages I and II) tumours (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.070). However, patients with predominant free prostate-specific antigen, had a higher percentage of well-differentiated (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.014) and early stage tumours (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003d;0.090) than patients with predominant bound prostate-specific antigen. In conclusion, although the sensitivity of free prostate-specific antigen predominancy is low (20&#x00025;), in distinguishing women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women, its specificity is high (96.7&#x00025;). Free prostate-specific antigen predominancy tends to be present in less aggressive tumours. These findings may indicate clinical significance of preoperative measurement of serum total and free prostate-specific antigen in women with colorectal carcinoma.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>86</bold>, 203&#x02013;206.

All women included in the study had been informed and their approvals were obtained. In 69 patients, the tumour could be resected while six tumours were unresectable due to adjacent organ and structure invasion. The location, size and histologic features of the tumour were reported by the referred pathologist. The size and histologic features of the unresected tumours were not included in the evaluation. Venous invasion was not examined in one of the resected tumours. Histologic type was divided in two subgroups as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (15 cases) and the others. In the second group, there were 47 moderately and three poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, three mucinous carcinomas and one signet ring cell carcinoma. The depth of invasion and staging of the disease were assessed according to TNM system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Fleming <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Two patients with unresected tumours and with no distant metastasis were included in advanced stage disease (stages III and IV).</p></sec><sec><title>PSA assays</title><p>Peripheral venous blood samples were drawn and centrifugated in healthy women and 2 to 24&#x02009;h before the operation in the colorectal cancer patients.

Total PSA measurements were performed with Coat-A-Count&#x000ae; PSA IRMA (DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA) kit and free PSA measurements were performed with Coat-A-Count&#x000ae; Free PSA IRMA (EURO/DPC Ltd, UK) kit, by utilizing solid-phase sequential immunoradiometric assay which is based on monoclonal and polyclonal anti-PSA antibodies.

On the other hand free PSA levels were significantly higher in women with colorectal carcinoma.</p><p>PSA measurements in nonprostatic carcinomas have been conducted mostly in women with breast cancer. It has been shown that serum total PSA levels in women with breast cancer were significantly higher than healthy women, and in women with breast cysts were significantly higher than women with breast cancer and serum free PSA levels in breast cancer patients were significantly higher than healthy women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Black <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Another study revealed serum total PSA concentrations to be significantly lower in women with breast cancer than women with benign breast disease and no significant difference was found between cancer patients and normal women; free PSA levels showed no difference in the groups (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al,</italic> 1997</xref>). In another study, no significant difference in serum total PSA levels was found between breast cancer patients and women with benign breast disease or healthy women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Romppanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Total PSA is the sum of different molecular forms of PSA existing in serum, that is, free (non-complexed) PSA and PSA complexed to &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-1-antichymotripsin. Recently, it has been demonstrated that free PSA/total PSA ratio in prostate cancer patients is lower than patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and the percentage of free PSA improves specificity and sensitivity of prostate cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Catalona <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">T&#x000f6;rnblom <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Veltri and Miller, 1999</xref>). Cut-off values proposed for per cent free PSA have ranged from 17 to 25&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Kamoi and Babaian, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Studies conducted in women with breast cancer revealed contrary results. It was demonstrated that 44&#x00025; of women with breast cancer and 58&#x00025; of women with benign breast disease had serum free PSA as the major molecular form, whereas normal women had PSA bound to &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antichymotripsin as the major molecular form, and it was suggested that the ratio of free PSA/bound PSA might have value for diagnosis of breast diseases including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). In another study (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Black <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), it was demonstrated that the percentage (20&#x00025;) of breast cancer patients with free PSA as the predominant molecular form (&#x0003e;50&#x00025; of total PSA) in serum was significantly higher than that of healthy women (3&#x00025;) or women with benign breast disease (4&#x00025;), and it was stated that although free PSA as the predominant molecular form has high specificity (96&#x00025;), its clinical utility is limited due to low sensitivity (20&#x00025;).</p><p>We concluded similar results as with the study mentioned above (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Black <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), in our study. The percentage of free PSA predominant subjects (free PSA/total PSA &#x0003e;50&#x00025;) in women with colorectal carcinoma was 20&#x00025;, which was significantly higher than healthy women (3.3&#x00025;). Although the sensitivity of free PSA predominancy was low (20&#x00025;) in distinguishing women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women, the specificity was higher (96.7&#x00025;) which justifies further investigations to clarify its clinical significance.</p><p>In our study, although serum total and free PSA levels were decreased as age increased both in women with colorectal carcinoma and healthy women, the correlations were not significant; the percentage of women older than 50 years was slightly lower in total PSA positive patients than negatives. In one study serum total PSA levels were found to decrease significantly with ageing in both healthy women and women with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Romppanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). However, in another study no significant correlation was found between serum total PSA levels and age in normal women while a negative correlation was demonstrated in women with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). As in the explanation of the decrease of PSA expression with ageing in breast cancer tissue (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 1994a</xref>), the decrease in PSA production with ageing might be due to the decrease of ovarian hormones which mediate PSA production by binding to the steroid receptors found in colorectal cancer tissue.</p><p>The cut-off values providing the specificity rate of 93.3&#x00025; in our series, were 0.34&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for total PSA and 0.01&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for free PSA. The cut-off value in breast cancer diagnosis for total PSA is 30&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Romppanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) which is 10 times lower than the value we found. This discrimination may be due to the difference in the sensitivities of PSA assays. With our cut-off values, in our series, total PSA positivity was 20&#x00025; and free PSA positivity was 34.6&#x00025; in women with colorectal carcinoma. With a cut-off value of 30&#x02009;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> total PSA positivity rates were reported to be 6.5&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) and 5.6&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Romppanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) in women with breast cancer.</p><p>We did not find any significant association with serum total PSA levels and the location, tumour size, depth of wall invasion or venous invasion. There was no well-differentiated tumour in total PSA positive patients while 26.8&#x00025; of the negative patients had well-differentiated tumours, the difference was nearly significant. In total PSA positive patients compared to negatives, there was a tendency to be in advanced stage disease and lymph node metastasis. No significant association could be found between free PSA positivity and the clinicopathological features. Well-differentiated tumours were significantly higher in patients with predominant free PSA; there was a tendency to be T<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;T<sub>2</sub> and early stage tumours in this group. There was no significant association with free PSA predominancy and other clinicopathological factors.</p><p>No significant relationship was found in breast cancer patients between serum total PSA levels and histologic grade or disease stage (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Borchert <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Romppanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). In another study no association was found between histologic grade and serum total PSA or free PSA predominancy (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Black <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In accordance with our results, it has been shown that in prostate cancer patients, the aggressiveness of the histologic grade increased significantly as the percentage of free PSA/total PSA decreased (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In summary, with a specificity rate of 93.3&#x00025;, the sensitivity rate for serum total PSA was 20&#x00025; and for serum free PSA, it was 34.6&#x00025; in women with colorectal carcinoma. Free PSA predominancy (free PSA/total PSA &#x0003e;50&#x00025;) showed a sensitivity rate of 20&#x00025; and a specificity rate of 96.7&#x00025; in distinguishing women with colorectal carcinoma than healthy women. Although total PSA positivity had a tendency to be present in aggressive histologic types and in advanced stage tumours, free PSA predominancy had a tendency to be present in well-differentiated and early stage tumours.</p><p>In conclusion, this data reveals that preoperative serum total and free PSA measurements may offer clinical significance in women with colorectal carcinoma and there is need for new studies including wider patient and control groups, utilizing ultrasensitive PSA assays whose lowest detection limit is lower.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation
