Promising results were obtained with 36 areas of Bowen's disease, with a complete response rate of 89% at a median follow-up of 18 months. The treatment of BCCs was less successful, with 50% complete responses in 16 lesions at a median follow-up of 17 months. Metastatic nodules responded poorly. The treatment was well tolerated and discomfort during light irradiation could be reduced by prior application of 'Emla' cream. Lesions wept for 1-2 weeks following treatment and healed over a period of approximately 2 months. For large areas of Bowen's disease, particularly in anatomically difficult areas and in elderly patients, PDT using ALA may constitute a single simple alternative outpatient treatment to existing therapies. Further work is required to improve the results with BCCs.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0201-a" xlink:role="607"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="605" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="606" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="607" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00193-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="608" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
