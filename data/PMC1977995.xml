Administration of G-CSF increased the numbers of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) by a median of 76-fold above basal levels. Maximal levels of PBPC were observed on days 5 and 6 after G-CSF treatment. In two patients a second cycle of G-CSF mobilised PBPC to levels comparable with those seen after the first cycle of G-CSF treatment. An earlier hemopoietic cell population (pre-CFC's) was also mobilised with levels increased up to 50-fold above basal levels. Using a standard mononuclear cell leukapheresis technique the PBPC were collected extremely efficiently (essentially 100%) and could be further successfully enriched by separation using a Ficoll gradient. For patients who underwent the optimal collection protocol (i.e. leukapheresis on days 5, 6 and 7) a total of 32 +/- 6 x 10(4) GM-CFC kg-1 were collected. The ability to mobilise PBPC using G-CSF alone and to successfully and efficiently harvest these cells has important implications for the future of transplantation and high dose chemotherapy procedures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0127.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="893" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="894" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="895" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="896" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="897" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="898" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00063-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="899" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
