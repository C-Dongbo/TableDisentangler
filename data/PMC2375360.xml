A humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; cross-linked with a bis-maleimide linker referred to as humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; maleimide was produced as a result of this design process. It is a humanised divalent antibody with no Fc, which can be produced in bacteria and has enhanced stability compared with F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>. Here we describe a clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer using humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; maleimide generated from the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody A5B7 radiolabelled with iodine-131. Ten patients received an i.v. injection of iodine-131-labelled A5B7 humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; maleimide, and positive tumour images were obtained by gamma camera imaging in eight patients with known lesions, and one previously undetected lesion was identified. True negative results were obtained in two patients without tumour. Area under the curve analysis of serial blood gamma counting and gamma camera images showed a higher tumour to blood ratio compared to A5B7 mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> used previously in the clinic, implying this new molecule may be superior for radioimmunotherapy. MIRD dose calculations showed a relatively high radiation dose to the kidney, which may limit the amount of activity that could be administered in radioimmunotherapy. However the reduction in immunogenicity was also a major advantage for A5B7 humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; maleimide over murine versions of this antibody suggesting that humanised divalent-Fab&#x02032; maleimide should be a useful vehicle for repeated therapies.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>86</bold>, 1401&#x02013;1410.

A5B7 IgG and its F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> fragment have been radiolabelled with <sup>125</sup>I for radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) and <sup>131</sup>I for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) and radio immunoscintigraphy (RIS) in patients with colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Theodorou, 1995</xref>). RIT has produced responses in patients after the failure of conventional 5 fluorouracil based chemotherapy treatments (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). The maximum tolerated dose of <sup>131</sup>I was 2.2&#x02009;GBq&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> with myelosuppression being the dose-limiting factor (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). This study also showed a more efficient early tumour uptake of the F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> fragment (two-fold increase) compared with the intact IgG.</p><p>A major limitation of RIT that has affected most clinical studies is the production of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) to murine immunoglobulins as this often prevents re-treatment. Anti-mouse antibodies form complexes with the tumour specific antibody, which are rapidly cleared from the circulation so preventing tumour localisation. Presently immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) are administered to reduce HAMA formation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Ledermann <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). In the most recent RIT study using A5B7 described by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic> (1994)</xref>, oral administration of CsA enabled up to four repeated treatments of <sup>131</sup>I-A5B7. However, use of immunosuppressive drugs is not favoured due to side effects and incomplete effectiveness.</p><p>The development of antibodies with low immunogenicity is therefore important to allow repeated administration in RIT. Technologies to generate human antibodies such as human hybridoma technology, transgenic or SCID-hu mice and recombinant libraries are now available for production of high affinity human antibodies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Borrebaeck <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Lonberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib30">Winter <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). As an alternative, existing murine antibodies have been reconstructed by grafting the critical portions of the antigen binding regions (CDR's) onto a human antibody framework (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib29">Verhoeyen <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>). Clinical trials involving several humanised antibodies are currently in various stages of progress (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Emery and Adair, 1994</xref>), and the results so far indicate that immunogenicity is in fact reduced or completely absent using this approach (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Hale and Phillips, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib26">Stephens <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Antibody engineering has enabled the design of antibodies with superior properties to whole IgG's for delivery of radionuclides for tumour imaging or therapy. We have recently performed a series of experiments to find the optimal characteristics of the antibody A5B7 for RIT. A5B7 was humanised to reduce immunogenicity and was found to target tumour effectively (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Adair <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>). In addition DFM was modified to contain a single hinge thiol suitable for chemical cross-linking to form multivalent di-Fab&#x02032; and tri-Fab&#x02032; molecules (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Casey <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). A comparison of the properties of murine A5B7 DFM and TFM with parent F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> and IgG was performed and kinetic analysis of antigen binding revealed that DFM had a significantly faster association rate than all other antibody forms (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Casey <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). This may be a consequence of the increased spacing or flexibility of the chemical cross-linker. Although the biodistribution data demonstrated equivalent tumour uptake levels it was concluded that <sup>131</sup>I -DFM due to its faster association rate might prove to be superior to <sup>131</sup>I -F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> in the clinic. In another study a re-oxidised version of humanised A5B7 hF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> was compared to chemically cross-linked hDFM; these are identical constructs apart from the bond between the two Fab&#x02032; arms. The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> stability was analysed and A5B7 hDFM proved to have a higher affinity and a significantly improved tumour uptake to the hF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Casey <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Although preclinical studies in nude mouse model systems provide valuable information in selecting the most appropriate form of antibody, pilot human investigations are necessary to assess whether a particular antibody will be clinically useful. In this study a batch of A5B7 hDFM, suitable for clinical purposes, was prepared to assess the safety and tumour targeting in patients with colorectal cancer, with the aim of the possible use of this humanised version of A5B7 for future RIT studies. Bacterial production of hFab&#x02032; was facilitated with the use of production scale fermentation, which is becoming an attractive alternative to mammalian expression systems, which are relatively expensive. A5B7 hDFM is one of the first antibodies to be produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> for the clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Production of clinical grade hDFM and mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub></title><p>Clinical grade A5B7 hDFM was produced in accordance to the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC) specified guidelines for production of recombinant proteins for clinical use in the UK (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Begent <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>).

Eight had metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer with tumour CEA production confirmed by raised serum CEA concentration or by positive CEA immunohistochemistry staining of biopsy specimens. Two further patients with suspected colorectal cancer recurrence acted as negative controls. One (patient 7) had a sacral bony metastasis suggested on a technetium<sup>99m</sup> bone scan but a subsequent biopsy did not confirm tumour recurrence. Another (patient 10) had an elevated tumour marker CA19-9, but subsequent conventional computerised tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as well as laparotomy failed to confirm a recurrence. Nineteen patients were recruited for the <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> study who had unresectable, locally recurrent or metastatic tumours, most patients had raised CEA levels at the time of recruitment for the study.</p><p>All patients required a WHO performance status of 0&#x02013;2, and gave written informed consent. The study was approved by ethics committee and covered by ARSAC licence. The thyroid was blocked with potassium iodide tablets (50&#x02009;mg tds) for 10 days beginning the day before the antibody scan, and potassium perchlorate (200&#x02009;mg qds for 1 day) on the day of administration. A few hours prior to the injection of radiolabelled antibody, patients were given an intradermal skin test injection to observe any adverse allergic reaction to the antibody.

Plasma samples collected from patients were analysed for ability to bind to antigen. Briefly, 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;l plasma samples were applied to microtitre wells coated with CEA or phosphate buffer (control) in duplicate and incubated for 1&#x02009;h at room temperature on a plate shaker.

An ELISA was designed to assess patients' immune response to hDFM, before and at 14 days and 2 months (approximately) after injection of radiolabelled antibody. We measured the human anti-human antibody response (HAHA) since hDFM contains a human antibody framework.

Low levels of breakdown products at lower molecular weight fractions were observed for all patients and increased as a per cent of the total recovered counts over time (data not shown). The calibration markers revealed that the molecular weight of this peak was &#x0003c;1.3&#x02009;kDa, and it is therefore likely that this peak is free iodine or iodo-tyrosine, which is released from antibody over time. At 10&#x02009;min post injection 2&#x02013;5&#x00025; of recovered activity eluted in the low molecular weight (&#x0003c;1.5&#x02009;kDa) fraction and this increased over time to 18&#x02013;26&#x00025; at 72&#x02009;h.</p><p>Low levels of aggregates, in the form of radioactivity appearing in high molecular weight fractions (void volume), was observed for some patients at later time points. This appeared to be related to the amount of CEA antigen in the circulation measured by serum ELISA. For two patients with relatively low levels of serum CEA (&#x02a7d;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) total aggregate formation to 26&#x02009;h was &#x02a7d;3.2&#x00025; and &#x02a7d;7.5&#x00025; up to 72&#x02009;h. For seven patients with intermediate levels of serum CEA (15&#x02013;79&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), aggregate formation to 24&#x02009;h of &#x02a7d;11.9&#x00025; and &#x02a7d;23.3&#x00025; to 72&#x02009;h was observed. For one patient (3) with a very high serum CEA level (2039&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), a large amount of aggregate formation was observed. Total aggregate formation to 24&#x02009;h of 29&#x00025; was observed which decreased slightly over time to 72&#x02009;h (16.4&#x00025;). Overall clearance of the hDFM peak for patient 3 was slightly faster than for most of the other patients but similar to patient 1, who had the third highest level of CEA (79&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). It is therefore likely that these aggregates were in the form of immune complexes consisting of serum CEA and hDFM, which resulted in faster clearance of antibody from the circulation.</p><p>Plasma samples were also analysed for binding to CEA coated ELISA plates as a measure of immunoreactivity. Positive binding (CPM) to CEA compared to control PBS wells was observed for all samples on the day of administration. However, since a large amount of antibody was cleared from the circulation in the first 24&#x02009;h, the dilution factor was too great to measure binding on subsequent days post administration.</p><p>Pre-treatment and post treatment (&#x0003e;14 day) serum samples were routinely collected to monitor immunogenicity. There was an increase in both IgM and IgG HAHA titre for patient 3, and there was evidence of a minor response in IgM titre for patient 5. There was no evidence of IgM or IgG response in the remaining eight patients in this study. Patient 3 was known to have a very high level of circulating CEA, and formation of immune complexes (&#x0003e;200&#x02009;kD) was observed by HPLC within 10&#x02009;min of antibody administration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A combination of molecular and chemical cross-linking technologies have been employed here to generate a new antibody construct that has some advantages over conventional intact antibodies and their fragments. This potentially less immunogenic humanised version of A5B7 hFab&#x02032; was the first recombinant and cross-linked form of A5B7 to be administered to patients. In addition this product was also one of a very limited number of antibodies to be produced in bacteria for the clinic (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Begent <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>It is a requirement of any regulatory organisation that new drugs to be administered for phase I/II clinical studies be thoroughly characterised and analysed for safety. The cell line, production and purification processes for A5B7 hDFM were validated and after full characterisation and toxicity studies the clinical batch was deemed suitable for patient administration (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Begent <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). One of the major advantages of antibody production in bacteria is the non-requirement for extensive testing for viruses and mammalian DNA, which is expensive and time consuming.</p><p>Storage conditions are important to assess prior to clinical use. However, one of the problems associated with any clinical study is the length of time allocated to this. Short-term stability studies for A5B7 hDFM were performed, but longer-term stability (1 year) revealed that storage conditions (PBS pH&#x02009;7.4, 4&#x000b0;C) were sub-optimal and resulted in some breakdown to hFab&#x02032; (approximately 10&#x00025;). Extensive stability studies of hDFM in various buffers at different temperatures are a necessary requirement before further clinical studies with this antibody are planned. Recent stability studies have shown improved stability of hDFM when stored in a lower pH buffer (pH&#x02009;5.5&#x02013;6) or in a lyophilised form.</p><p>In this pilot imaging study of 10 patients injected with <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM, at least one known tumour site was localised in all patients, with tumour recurrence shown by conventional imaging techniques. This provided clinically useful information in either confirming patients had recurrent disease, identifying a new lesion (one patient), or confirming there was no disease (two patients). The three false negative findings were in two patients. In one patient a lung metastasis and local recurrence and in the other a lung metastasis, were not disclosed by antibody imaging but were seen by CT.</p><p>Blood clearance kinetics defined in all 10 patients demonstrated similar blood clearance and half-lives to mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> in man. This was surprising as direct comparisons for murine parent antibodies and engineered chimeric or humanised versions of the same antibody have frequently resulted in prolonged half-lives (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">LoBuglio <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). However, a direct comparison of humanised antibody fragments with the murine equivalent has not been carried out previously. Also half-life is known to be dependent on protein dose, resulting in an increased clearance rate of lower doses of the same antibody (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib26">Stephens <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). This may be particularly relevant when circulating antigen may be present as in this case. A relatively high dose of A5B7 mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> (10&#x02009;mg per patient) was administered to patients for RIT compared to the imaging dose of 0.5&#x02009;mg hDFM administered in this study. Therefore a longer circulating half-life may be observed for higher therapy doses of hDFM.</p><p>Some studies have attempted to address the relationship of circulating antigen and half-life (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Davidson <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Pimm, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Behr <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). In one study, data from 275 patients was analysed, and results implied that antibodies administered to patients with normal plasma CEA (&#x0003c;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) had longer half-lives than in patients with CEA levels in excess of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Behr, 1996</xref>). In this study only two patients had CEA levels &#x0003c;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (patients 7 and 10) and their plasma or blood half-life was not significantly different to the other patients. However for one patient (3) with very high levels of CEA (2039&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) formation of antibody complexes was observed by HPLC soon after antibody administration. This resulted in faster clearance of hDFM from the circulation and a corresponding shorter &#x003b2;-half-life in blood of 14&#x02009;h compared to the median of 20.3&#x02009;h. Low tumour uptake levels, especially at early time points (2&#x02009;h&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;0.9&#x00025; i.a.&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, median value 4&#x00025;), may have been the result of more rapid clearance of hDFM from the circulation. Despite this however, positive tumour imaging was reported.</p><p>The biodistribution of <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM was extensively studied by gamma camera imaging at various scanning times to enable quantification of absorbed dose to radiosensitive organs. The results were compared to similar clinical data using <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>) in an attempt to assess whether <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM would be a better candidate for RIT studies. AUC (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) estimates revealed a higher overall tumour to blood ratio for hDFM (1.07) compared to mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> (0.89) which is desirable for RIT.</p><p>AUC (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and MIRD (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) estimates indicated a similar biodistribution and clearance of both fragments except for high kidney uptake of <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM. In nude mice experiments we have observed similar biodistribution patterns including kidney uptake for <sup>131</sup>I-labelled hDFM, mDFM and mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>, implying that this high kidney uptake of <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM was specific only to man.</p><p>It is unclear why there are major differences in kidney uptake of hDFM and mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>; the altered clearance pattern of similar sized molecules suggests that other factors such as shape and charge may also influence the rate of clearance via the kidney (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib27">Sumpio and Hayslett, 1985</xref>). The presence of the thio-ether bond could in some way affect the clearance of hDFM leading to non-specific uptake by the renal tubules. High stability of the thio-ether bond could result in slower catabolism resulting in a longer kidney residence time. We observed breakdown of hDFM to hFab&#x02032; occurring in the kidney's as analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiography of urine samples, indicating renal catabolism occurs. Further experiments were performed to assess whether hDFM cross-reacted with human kidney samples from four individuals, by performing immunohistochemistry experiments. These findings showed no non-specific binding of hDFM to normal human kidney, indicating there was no binding to a renal antigen.</p><p>Dosimetry estimates indicate that the dose-limiting organ for hDFM is the kidney, and if hDFM is to be considered for RIT it would obviously be desirable to reduce kidney levels of activity. A promising option is to attach polyethylene glycol (PEG) to hDFM which in a recent study in nude mice bearing human colorectal tumour xenografts was shown to increase the circulatory half-life resulting in higher tumour uptake levels and a lower absorbed dose to the kidney (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Casey <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The red bone marrow is highly radiosensitive and myelosuppression often limits the total dose that may be administered therapeutically (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Siegel <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>). It is therefore important to assess the toxicity to bone marrow and other radiosensitive organs, such as the kidney, in low-dose clinical studies such as the one described here, to predict possible toxicity on administration of higher doses. Dose to the red bone marrow is usually assumed to be proportional to the blood dose, where marrow dose is equivalent to blood dose&#x000d7;0.4 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Siegel <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>). The maximum tolerated doses (MTD) for radiosensitive organs such as red bone marrow and kidney have been evaluated by conventional radiotherapy studies to be &#x0003c;200 and &#x0003c;1500&#x02009;cGy respectively (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Fawwaz <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>). Therefore, by considering these limits, the maximum tolerated activity can be estimated using the MIRD dosimetry calculations for <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM and <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> illustrated in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The MTD that allows for maximum kidney tolerance would be: 1500/0.186&#x0003d;8.06&#x02009;GBq for <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM, and 1500/0.0805&#x0003d;18.6&#x02009;GBq for <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>; and for maximum tolerance to the red marrow and bone surface: 200/0.0109&#x0003d;18.4&#x02009;GBq for <sup>131</sup>I-hDFM, and 200/0.0124&#x0003d;16.1&#x02009;GBq for <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>. This implies that the dose limiting organ for hDFM is the kidney and the bone marrow for mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>. However, these are estimated doses, and an organised dose escalation study involving detailed toxicity assessment is required before a true MTD is obtained. The MTD for A5B7 <sup>131</sup>I-mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> has previously been shown to be approximately 3.29&#x02009;GBq&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>), implying that the MIRD weighting for red marrow is underestimated, as toxicity was observed at much lower levels than was anticipated using the MIRD estimates.</p><p>Although there is at present little data to suggest renal damage after RIT, impairment of renal function has been observed with whole abdominal irradiation in patients given doses &#x0003e;20&#x02009;Gy. However with similar or higher doses administered in a fractionated manner there has been no evidence of renal toxicity up to 5 years after treatment (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Irwin <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Although the toxicity levels of external whole body irradiation and RIT cannot be directly compared, this implies that a fractionated approach to administration of hDFM may also be worth considering.</p><p>In the present study only one patient elicited a positive immune response 2 weeks after <sup>131</sup>I-A5B7 hDFM injection. However, this patient also had a level of high circulating CEA and evidence of immune complexes soon after antibody injection. Immune complexes may cause an increase in the propensity to produce anti-antibodies due to increased recognition by cells of the immune system. This is effectively similar to the natural host defence mechanism by the immune system on attack by a foreign antigen when host antibodies complex with antigen and present the antigen as foreign to cells of the immune system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Roitt, 1991</xref>). A similar mechanism may occur here when circulating host antigen complexes with foreign antibody.</p><p>There have been only a few reports describing the immunogenicity of humanised antibodies in clinical studies, and as yet no studies involving humanised fragments. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Hale <italic>et al</italic> (1988)</xref> reported that lymphoma patients treated with multiple doses of this antibody showed no antibody response to a humanised version of CAMPATH-1H. In a further study CAMPATH-1H was administered to rheumatoid arthritis patients repeatedly over 10 days. No immune response was reported following this first course of treatment but following the second course of treatment three out of four patients showed a detectable immune response. However this immune response was not characterised. In another study the humanised antibody CDP571 was administered as a single dose ranging from 0.1&#x02013;10&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to human volunteers (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib26">Stephens <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). At low doses a weak immune response of IgM anti-idiotype was detectable and at higher doses responses were lower or undetectable. In a pilot imaging study none of the four patients with B-cell lymphomas receiving 2&#x02009;mg of the humanised LL2 antibody developed an immune response (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Juweid <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). In a further small study, eight patients received the anti-CEA humanised hMN-14 antibody (0.5&#x02013;20&#x02009;mg) and the immune response was measured in five patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Sharkey <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). Four of these patients received 2&#x02013;3 injections and two received high protein doses (10&#x02013;20&#x02009;mg). An immune response was not recorded for any of these patients during the 4&#x02013;5 week follow up period.</p><p>These initial results suggest that humanised antibodies are less immunogenic than murine antibodies, especially at higher concentrations, and therefore should enable repeated administration. However, all of the above studies, including the one described here, involved small numbers of patients, low doses and usually only one injection of humanised antibody. Further analysis is necessary to study the immune response of humanised antibodies and fragments in larger clinical studies. If hDFM is to be considered for RIT, studies must be performed to determine whether the immunogenicity of hDFM will remain low at higher doses and after multiple injections. Furthermore the potential immunogenicity of the maleimide linker is a significant issue. Clearly, in future clinical studies involving higher doses of antibodies or fragments containing the maleimide cross-linker characterisation of the immune response is essential. There have to date been no reported studies to indicate that the maleimide linker is immunogenic in animals or patients.</p><p>It is our aim to design an antibody construct based on the IgG A5B7, which has optimal properties for RIT. We have shown in this pilot clinical study that A5B7&#x0200a;<sup>131</sup>I-hDFM proved to be effective in targeting tumours in all patients with known lesions with a median maximum of 4.1&#x00025; of the total injected activity. The area under the curve data revealed a higher estimated tumour to blood ratio for A5B7 hDFM compared to A5B7 mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> implying it will be superior for RIT. The only problem that did not become evident until this clinical trial was performed was the high level of kidney uptake in patients. We have further optimised DFM by the addition of PEG, which in our nude mouse model showed superior tumour uptake levels and lower kidney toxicity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Casey <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that it is possible to engineer superior antibody products for optimal tumour targeting. The clinical study revealed improved tumour localisation and lower immunogenicity for hDFM compared to mF(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub>; therefore indicating that hDFM should prove to be our optimal form of A5B7 anti-CEA antibody for future RIT.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank C Pagonis, L Light and the staff of the Drug Development Office, Cancer Research UK for assistance in protocol development, data monitoring and data analysis.
