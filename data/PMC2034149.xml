Fifty-six treatment cycles were given to 18 patients. The drug was well tolerated. Only one partial tumour response was documented. The patients were heavily pretreated but had chemoresponsive disease, as shown by a response rate of 69% among 13 patients who went on to receive alternative cytotoxic regimens. We conclude that temozolomide given in this schedule is inactive in previously treated low-grade NHL.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="183" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00041-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="184" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
