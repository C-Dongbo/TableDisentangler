Histology was diffuse large cell in 29 (60%) patients; immunoblastic, diffuse mixed cell and lymphoblastic in four each; follicular large cell, diffuse small cleaved cell and diffuse small non-cleaved cell in one each; and unclassified in four. Ann Arbor stage was IV in 44 patients, and IE or IIE in four. Tumour mass &#x0003e; or = 10 cm, performance status (ECOG scale) &#x0003e; 2 and increased LDH level were present in 69%, 20% and 76% of patients respectively. Fifteen patients (31%) had multiple intraparenchymal nodules, 14 (29%) had direct spread into the kidney from a perirenal mass, ten (21%) had a single intraparenchymal nodule and nine (19%) had diffuse infiltration. Twenty-one patients (43%) presented with bilateral lesions. Three patients (6%) presented with acute renal failure. Ten other patients (21%) had serum creatinine &#x0003e; 120 mumol l-1. In 12 of these 13 patients renal function was restored with chemotherapy. Twenty-eight patients (57%) achieved complete remission. Estimated 4 year disease-free survival was 39%. Disease-free survival and actuarial survival at 4 years were estimated to be 58% respectively. Two renal parameters had adverse prognostic significance for survival: renal hilum involvement (P = 0.02) and diffuse renal infiltration (P = 0.01). A Cox model identified only two independent prognostic factors for survival, namely performance status &#x0003e; or = 2 and tumour size &#x0003e; or = 10 cm. We conclude that alteration in renal function occurs in 27% of patients with renal involvement. Systemic chemotherapy improves renal function rapidly. Long-term outcome is similar to that expected in NHL patients presenting with the same prognostic factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="154" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="155" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="156" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="157" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="158" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="159" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
