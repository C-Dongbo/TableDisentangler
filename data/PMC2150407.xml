To improve the prognosis of patients with CLL, we have designed a sequential treatment strategy that comprises intensive chemotherapy for mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) and induction of minimal disease, followed by high-dose radiochemotherapy with stem cell reinfusion and post-transplant molecular monitoring by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the complementary determining region III (CDRIII) gene. In a prospective study, we have evaluated this protocol in 18 patients with CLL, also including early stages of the disease. The median age was 49 (29-61) years; Binet stages were A, six; B, nine; and C, three. Adverse prognostic factors [high lymphocyte count and/or diffuse bone marrow (BM) infiltration] were present in 16 out of 18 patients. All patients showed a clone-specific molecular marker as demonstrated by PCR amplification of CDRIII rearrangements. For stem cell mobilization and reduction of tumour load, one to two cycles of Dexa-BEAM chemotherapy were administered, resulting in minimal disease (circulating lymphoma cells &#x0003c;1 x 10(9) l(-1); BM infiltration &#x0003c;20%; lymphomas &#x0003c;2 cm) in 16 out of 18 patients, including four patients who already had minimal disease before Dexa-BEAM. Stem cell harvesting was successful in 14 patients. All grafts [three BM, 11 peripheral blood (PB)] were purged from leukaemic cells using immunomagnetic methods. Thirteen patients having achieved minimal disease were reinfused with purged autologous stem cells (ASC) after preparation with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. Engraftment was delayed in patients receiving BM (n = 3) but prompt [neutrophils &#x0003e;0.5 x 10(9) l(-1) after 10 (9-13) days, platelets &#x0003e;20 x 10(9) l(-1) after 11 (9-214) days] in patients restored with PBPCs (n = 10). Procedure-related deaths did not occur. Although the results of CDRIII PCR suggest persistence or recurrence of the leukaemic clone in at least three cases, to date only one patient has relapsed, whereas all others survive without clinical evidence of disease with a maximum follow-up of 48 months. We conclude that sequential high-dose therapy using Dexa-BEAM and autologous stem cell transplantation is a safe and highly effective treatment for patients with CLL. However, a longer follow-up is needed to assess whether definite cures can be achieved using this strategy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2291" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2292" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2293" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2294" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2295" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2296" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00088-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2297" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
