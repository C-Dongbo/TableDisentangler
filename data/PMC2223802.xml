Biochemical response [&#x0003e; or = 50% reduction in pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after three cycles of &#x0003e; or = 3 weeks' duration] was demonstrated in 13 of 24 patients included (54%). No objective response (WHO criteria) was observed, although seven of nine evaluable patients achieved a &#x0003e; or = 50% serum PSA reduction. Subjective improvement (pain score, performance status) occurred in 7 of 24 patients, whereas nine patients progressed subjectively. There was no correlation between subjective and biochemical response. Biochemical progression (&#x0003e; or = 50% increase of nadir PSA) occurred after a median of 12 weeks. All but two patients were alive after a median follow-up time of 8.7 months for surviving patients (range 3.3-13.2). Eight patients experienced grade 3/4 leucopenia, with no indication of cumulative myelosuppression. Cardiovascular toxicity was experienced by four patients. Two patients developed angioedema twice, in one patient requiring hospitalization at the intensive ward. Based on this limited series, the combination of EPR and EMP in patients with HRPC is tolerable and appears to be effective in terms of significant PSA reduction. The results warrant further investigations of the two drugs and, in particular, of the clinical significance of &#x0003e; or = 50% PSA decrease in patients with HRPC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="93" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="94" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="95" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="96" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="97" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="98" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00165-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="99" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
