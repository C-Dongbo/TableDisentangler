Thirty patients of ages from 15 to 35 years with recurrent or persistent pneumothorax were involved in this study. The subjects consisted of 27 males and three females. The indications for videothoracoscopic surgery were ipsilateral recurrent pneumothorax in 12 (40%), persistent air leakage in 15 (50%), visible bullae in 2 (6%), and 1 bilateral pneumothorax (3%). The mean operation time was 42.9+/-12.9 min. The average number of uses for Endo-GIA was 1.9+/-1.3 times and chest tube indwelling time was 3.8+/-2.7 days. The average amount of keptoprofen (100 mg/2 mL/ampule) used on the first postoperative day was 1.2+/-1.1 ampules. No parenteral opioids were given to the patients for pain control after the procedures. After a follow up of 8 to 20 months, there was only one recurrence among the patients. In conclusion, a 2 mm videothoracoscope, in selective cases, can be successfully used as conventional videothoracoscope to manage persistent or recurrent pneumothorax with cosmetically excellent results.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
