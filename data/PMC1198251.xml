These epigenetic phenomena co-participate in regulation of gene transcription: for instance, histone deacetylases which deacetylate histone core tails are recruited by DNA methyltransferases and methyl-binding proteins, which in turn lead to tighter chromatin packaging, reducing access of transcriptional factors to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>HDACs are seen as a potential target for cancer treatment. HDAC inhibition has been reported to induce tumor cell differentiation, apoptosis, or growth arrest, depending on the experimental system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that histone acetylation can increase the efficiency of several anticancer drugs targeting the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]; studies also shown that HDAC activity inhibitors enhance <italic>in vitro </italic>sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, a significant impediment in targeting HDAC has been lack of a clinically applicable HDAC inhibitor.</p><p>Valproic acid, an 8-carbon, branched-chained fatty acid, is a well-known and effective antiepileptic drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its pharmacologic effects involve a variety of mechanisms including increased gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic transmission, reduced release and/or effects of excitatory amino acids, blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, and modulation of dopaminergic and serotoninergic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Because of its effectiveness, good tolerability, and oral bioavailability, valproic acid is widely used as a chronic anti-convulsant therapy.</p><p>It was recently reported that valproic acid is an effective inhibitor of histone deacetylases at concentrations well within the therapeutic range used for epilepsy. As such, valproic acid relieves repression of transcription factors that recruit histone deacetylases and activates transcription from diverse promoters. Valproic acid causes hyperacetylation of the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It inhibits HDAC activity, most probably by binding to the catalytic center and thereby blocking substrate access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to other HDAC inhibitors, valproic acid has a good tolerability and safety profile as demonstrated by 35 years of use as a chronic therapy for epileptic disorders. It has a serum half-life of 9&#x02013;18 h and is administered orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; however, the dose needed for observing its HDAC inhibitory activity in tumors of cancer patients is yet unknown.

The first observation is the ample heterogeneity in degree of baseline acetylation in both H3 and H4 histones. Pre-treatment band was hardly seen for acetylated H3 in patients 1 and 11, whereas it was very strong in patient 6; likewise, acetylated H4 was very weak in patients 3, 5, and 11. In assessment of valproate treatment effect, there was variable increase in band intensity, indicative of hyperacetylation of H3 in all patients except in patient 6. With regard to acetylation of H4, seven patients (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12) had clear hyperacetylation, whereas in the remaining individuals (patients 8, 9, and 10) the effect was minor or non-existent.

HDAC inhibition induces accumulation of hyperacetylated nucleosome core histones in the majority of chromatin regions but affects expression of only a small subset of genes, leading to transcriptional activation of some but repression of an equal or larger number of other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This led to testing HDAC inhibitors as anticancer agents in a variety of tumor models and clinical studies. To date, a number of structurally distinct classes of compounds have been identified as HDAC inhibitors including hydroxamates, cyclic tetrapeptides, benzamides, and short-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The discovery that valproic acid-which belongs to the short-chain fatty acids category and resulted to be an effective HDAC inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]-encouraged investigation of this agent as a potential cancer therapy agent. Valproic acid can be administered as such or as sodium or magnesium salts, but all three forms have the same pharmacokinetic behaviour and anticonvulsant effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that magnesium valproate, when used at only slightly higher doses than those used as anticonvulsant, not only produces H3 and H4 histone hyperacetylation in PBMN cells but also leads to hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 and inhibition of HDAC activity in tumors.</p><p>Preclinical data has shown that valproic acid inhibits the majority of class I and II HDAC at CI50, varying from 0.7&#x02013;1.3 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; however, the concentration needed <italic>in vitro </italic>to achieve its biological effects varies from system to system, but in some cases the concentration required is lower than 0.5 mM in tumors such as glioma, hematopoietic, or breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also known that the inhibitory effect of valproic acid on HDAC begins and disappears within hours after exposure, with a rapid return of baseline acetylation on histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This knowledge suggests that valproic acid, for effective use in the clinical setting, should be administered continuously and perhaps for long periods. Nonetheless, despite the fact that the therapeutic window of valproic acid is very wide (50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g/mL), there is a clear dose-effect relationship with depressed level of consciousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] therefore we felt important to investigate if doses below 60 mg/Kg which produce grade III toxicity lead to histone hyperacetylation in tumors.</p><p>These facts led to us to perform this phase I study to find the "adequate" biological dose of magnesium valproate. The advent of the so called "targeted therapies" has led to reconsider the appropriateness of the traditional or classical designs for phase I trials which takes into account toxicity as the most important parameter for dose escalation. Instead some authors have proposed that the endpoint in phase I studies of targeted therapies should be a change in the level or activity of the target or enzyme or other surrogate marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Because it is clear that the antiproliferative, differentiating and/or pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors result from the histone hyperacetylation it seems logical to evaluate the acetylation status of H3 and H4 histones as the endpoint of the trial. On the other hand, not necessarily, the highest hyperacetylation should occur at the higher dose of the tested agent, being possible that a plateau in the effect can be seen in a range of doses that do not produce limiting toxicity. In this sense, the concept of "adequate" instead of the "optimal" biological dose emerges because, by one hand, the number of patients required for finding the optimal dose may be to high for an agent that by itself (or as a single agent) is expected to produce a negligible clinical response rate or tumor shrinkage which equate to expose a larger number of patients to a potentially ineffective agent by its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Another issue for selecting adequate instead of optimal dose design is the fact that it allows investigators to quickly proceed to phase II trials (usually along with chemotherapy or radiation). Perhaps the only situation where an optimal dose design is preferred accounts when the study drug is planned to proceed to larger phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>On this basis, we opted to perform an "adequate" dose phase I. To our surprise, using doses as low as 20&#x02013;40 mg/kg, the biological effect was observed, being remarkable that no patient presented any grade 3 event. In nine patients, depressed level of consciousness was grade 2. Molecular efficacy in terms of H3 and H4 hyperacetylation in tumors was observed in most patients; in fact if we take into account the effects on H3, at 20 mg/Kg 2 out of 2 evaluated (100%) had hyperacetylation, 3 out of 4 at 30 mg/Kg (75%), and 4 out of 4 (100%) patients at 40 mg/Kg. For H4 a very similar pattern emerged 2/2 (100%), 3/4 (75%) and 2/4 (50%) had hyperacetylation at 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg/Kg. When evaluating for both H3 and H4 acetylation the numbers are 2/2 (100%), 2/4 (50%), and 2/4 (50%). Overall, despite the limited number of patients, inherent to the study design it is clear that at the range of doses tested there is a plateau in the molecular response (100%, 50% and 50%) for the three tested doses. In cases like this when there is a tie in efficacy, the highest dose should be selected, and hence we have selected the dose of 40 mg/Kg for our phase II studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there is no information concerning the effect of HDAC inhibitors upon acetylation of H3 and H4 in solid tumors of patients. Two reports on depsipeptide have demonstrated hyperacetylation of PBMN cells in two patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and two patients with refractory neoplasms as evaluated by immunoflouorescent labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; additionally, in a clinical study of SAHA for lymphoma and solid tumors it was reported that three of five patients showed increased accumulation of acetylated H3 in the post-treatment biopsy sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These data are in agreement with our findings indicating that the hyperacetylating effect is clinically achievable with these HDAC inhibitors.</p><p>The inhibitory activity of HDAC in cells shown by this class of compounds always parallels changes in H3 and H4 acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We demonstrate herein that valproic acid produces a decrease in HDAC activity in tumors which is accompanied by histone hyperacetylation suggesting that the H3 and H4 hyperacetylation occurring in tumors is a consequence of HDAC inhibition. On the other hand, it is remarkable that three out of the four cases assayed by H3 and H4 acetylation by western blot in PBMN cells (patients 1, 5 and 8) their corresponding tumors had hyperacetylation showing the concordance between the findings in tumors and PBMN cells. These data suggest that HDAC activity in the tumor or H3 and H4 acetylation status in the PBMN cells can be good surrogate markers for monitoring the effect of HDAC inhibitors in clinical trials.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of valproic acid has extensively been studied. Because its half-life is between 8&#x02013;16 hours, the steady-state concentrations can be determined as soon as at day 4 of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Under this rational we determined the levels of valproic acid at day six, within 8&#x02013;10 hours of the last dose taken, hence the sera values obtained are representative of the levels at the steady-state. High interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of valproic acid in epileptic patients is well-known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This phenomenon was observed in our study with serum concentrations ranging from 73.61 to 170.49 &#x003bc;g/mL, and in addition there was no correlation with dose level and mean concentration achieved; thus, for doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg, mean concentrations were 94.06, 123.46, and 90.93 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively. This finding, however, could be derived from the small number of patients we analyzed, because Tisdale et al. demonstrated significant linear correlation between VPA dose and serum concentration in a sample of 60 epileptic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Alternatively, it can be suggested that like in cell lines, which show high variability in response to HDAC inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], interpatient variability in tumors may exist.</p><p>There is one report in abstract form proceeding from a clinical study with valproic acid. Atmaca et al., performed a "traditional" dose escalating phase I study using valproic acid by intravenous infusion in patients with advanced cancer. In the study, 26 patients pre-treated and with progressive malignant disease received the drug by 1-h infusion split twice a day for 5 consecutive days, repeating the treatment at intervals of 2 weeks in cohorts of 60, 75, 90, and 120 mg/kg dosages. These investigators found maximum tolerated dose of 60 mg/kg because 9 of 26 patients presented grade 3/4 neurological toxicity. In addition, these authors reported hyperacetylation of PBMN cells in the majority of patients; nevertheless, they provided no information on serum levels achieved or the molecular response according to the dose level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>In a phase I-II study of the combination of decitabine and valproic acid for myeloblastic acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, a fixed dose of 15 mg/m2 of decitabine and valproic acid at 20, 35 and 50 mg/Kg were administered every 10 days. The toxicity observed was grade III neurotoxicity at 50 mg/Kg in 1 of 10 and grade II in 5 out 10 patients. Subsequently, VPA 50 mg/kg was chosen for the phase II portion of the study. Of 40 evaluable for response, an overall response rate of 22% (8 PR and 1 CR) was observed. Interestingly, the response rates according to the valproic acid dose were 33% for 20 mg, 11% for the 35 mg and 25% for the 50 mg/Kg dose level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Finally, in a third phase I study for metastatic solid tumors valproic acid was administered as an IV loading dose followed by 5 doses of oral doses given every 12 hours followed by a dose of epirubicin at day 3. At the time of reporting, 16 patients have been treated at 4 dose levels: VPA 15, 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg; with epirubicin at 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached and dose escalation is continuing. Major responses were observed in all tumor types including in anthracycline failures and in anthracycline-resistant cancers such as melanoma and cervical carcinoma. Plasma levels were not reported, however, there were above the concentrations needed for in-vitro synergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The extensive use of valproate as anticonvulsant has shown excellent tolerability in the therapeutic range between 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Despite the fact that levels &#x0003e;100 &#x003bc;g/mL are considered supra-therapeutic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], it must be stressed that in the our present study four patients presented concentrations higher than that level (109.12, 146.56, 170.49, and 107.43 &#x003bc;g/mL), and that none of these patients presented any grade 3 toxicity, which indicates the feasibility of achieving these levels during treatment to maximize the chances of producing tumor hyperacetylation. In fact, significant clinical adverse effects of valproic acid ingestion, such as lethargy, coma, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension, are more likely to occur with concentrations &#x0003e;450 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>All together, existing data suggest that molecular and clinical responses occur at valproic acid doses between 20 and 60 mg/Kg. The optimal biological dose of valproic acid remains to be determined, however, our results suggest the existence of a plateau in the histone acetylation at doses between 20 and 40 mg/Kg. Based on that we have chosen 40 mg/Kg as the dose to test in phase II trials.</p><p>Synergy of HDAC inhibitors with demethylating agents for reactivating expression of tumor suppressor genes as well as to induce antitumor effects is well-known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In this regard, our group showed that hydralazine is an effective demethylating agent that reactivates the tumor suppressor genes expression silenced by methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and reported the results of a phase I study demonstrating the gene demethylating and reactivating activity of the drug at doses between 75 and 150 mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. On these bases, we at present are testing these two drugs-demethylating hydralazine and the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid-plus chemotherapy or plus chemoradiation in phase II studies for solid tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results provide evidence that magnesium valproate at doses between 20 mg and 40 mg/Kg, inhibits deacetylase activity and hyperacetylates histones in tumor tissues.

(The post-treatment biopsy and peripheral blood sampling were taken in the early morning, between 8 and 10 hours after the last dose of magnesium valproate). Part of the biopsy was sent to the Institution's Pathology Department for routine Hematoxilin &#x00026; eosin diagnosis. The remaining biopsy specimen was immediately frozen at -20&#x000b0;C for biological analyses.

Briefly, tumor samples and mononuclear cell pellets were suspended in 10 volumes of PBS and centrifuged at 200 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 10 min. Cells were then suspended with five volumes of lysis buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and hydrochloride acid at a final concentration of 0.2 M and subsequently lysed on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 11,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, the cell supernatant fraction that contained acid-soluble proteins was retained. Supernatant was dialyzed against 200 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid twice for 1&#x02013;2 h each and then dialyzed against 200 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O for 1 h, 3 h, and overnight.
