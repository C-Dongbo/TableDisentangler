RhIL-6 (150 microgram) was administered as a daily subcutaneous injection for 42 consecutive days on an outpatient basis. Forty-nine patients were studied, 12 with and 37 without previous immunotherapy. Forty patients were evaluable for response. A partial remission was noted in two patients, stable disease in 17 and progressive disease in 21. Toxicity was moderate and reversible and consisted mainly of fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, weight loss and hepatotoxicity. Anaemia, leucocytosis and thrombocytosis and induction of acute phase protein synthesis were noted in most patients. In 15% of the patients anti-IL-6 antibodies developed, and were neutralising in only one patient. Baseline plasma IL-6 concentrations did not correlate with tumour behaviour before or after rhIL-6 treatment. In conclusion, rhIL-6 can be safely administered on an outpatient basis for prolonged period of time and has moderate, reversible toxicity. Its administration induces IL-6-antibody production in only a minority of patients. Antitmour effects of rhIL-6 in metastatic renal cancer are limited.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="789" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="790" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="791" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="792" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="793" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
