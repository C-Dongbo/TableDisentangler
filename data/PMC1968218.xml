Twenty-one patients with a variety of previously treated lymphoid malignancies received a total of 41 courses of 2CDA (0.1-0.15 mg/kg/day over 7 days continuous intravenous infusion) on compassionate grounds. The profile of the patient population was as follows: low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) = 8, intermediate grade NHL = 2, transformed (intermediate grade NHL) = 6, Hodgkin's disease = 1, lymphoplasmacytoid NHL = 3 and lymphoblastic NHL = 1. The overall response rate was 53%, with three patients attaining complete remission (CR) and eight partial remission (PR). Three of 16 patients with primary resistant or resistant recurrent disease entered either CR (1) or PR (2). Ten patients had no response or progressive disease. The latter group was comprised of patients who had extensively pre-treated lymphoplasmacytoid tumours and/or poor performance status (WHO grades 2-4). The median duration of response is 6 months (range 1 to 12 months). Treatment was well tolerated and the chief toxicities were leucopenia and thrombocytopenia which were most pronounced when there was bone marrow involvement. As a result of dose limiting myelotoxicity, a dose escalation to 0.15 mg/kg/day was possible on just three occasions. These data confirm other reports of the activity of 2CDA in low grade NHL and indicate it may have activity in Hodgkin's disease. There was no demonstrable activity in poor performance status patients or those with extensively pre-treated lymphoplasmacytoid tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="139" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="140" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="141" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="142" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="143" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
