All patients were treated with regimens comprising high dose cisplatin (80-100 mg m-2). Histologically there were 29 squamous cell and 11 undifferentiated NPC. Thirty-nine patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. The overall response rate was 64%, with a 20.5% complete response rate and a 43.5% partial response rate. The mean duration of complete responses was 10.2+months, while that of partial responses was 8.6+months. The mean survival of the whole group was 11.4+months, with four patients alive after 2 years of follow-up. No statistically significant difference in response rate and survival was found between patients with metastatic disease and those with locoregional recurrency, and between patients with squamous cell NPC and those with undifferentiated histology. The employed regimens have been generally well tolerated. These data confirm that NPC is a neoplasm highly responsive to chemotherapy. However, duration of objective response and survival are still largely unsatisfactory.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="191" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="192" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="193" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00197-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="194" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
