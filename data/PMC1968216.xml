The initial dose was 50 Units Kg-1 of body weight. If response was not achieved within 3 weeks, dose was increased to 75 Units Kg-1. Using the same criteria further escalation to 100 Units Kg-1 was performed. If there was no response erythropoietin was terminated. Fifteen patients obtained an increase in haemoglobin to above 100 gl-1 which was considered as a clinical response in this study, with a dose of 50 Units Kg-1; one patient needed an erythropoietin dose of 75 Units Kg-1 and one a dose of 100 Units Kg-1. Only three patients required haemotransfusions and were considered non responders. Haemoglobin increases occurred despite continuation of cisplatin chemotherapy. In conclusion subcutaneous low dose of erythropoietin seems to be effective and safe in the treatment of cisplatin-induced anaemia.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="156" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="157" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="158" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
