All of the patients had extensive disease and 17 had received prior therapy. Patients with disease refractory to primary chemotherapy were excluded. Forty-one treatment cycles were given (median two, range one to four). The drug was well tolerated. No objective tumour response was documented. The patients had chemoresistant disease, as shown by a response in only one of ten patients who went on to receive alternative cytotoxic regimens. We conclude that raltitrexed given in this schedule is inactive as second line therapy for small-cell lung cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="264" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00166-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="265" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
