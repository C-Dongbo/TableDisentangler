The tumours were graded histologically and these results were compared with the oestrogen receptor (ER) status of the tumours, the numbers of recurrences and the length of survival of the patients. It was found that histological grading was predictive both in terms of events and survival, and correlates significantly with oestrogen receptor status; within histological grades I and II, patients receiving 'Nolvadex' had fewer events and deaths compared with patients in the control group. For patients with grade III tumours qualitatively it was in the same direction as the benefit obtained in patients with grade I and II tumours.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="612" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="613" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00140-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="614" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
