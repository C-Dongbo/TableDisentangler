This study was designed to determine whether the clinical responses (healing, or non-healing) were correlated with the susceptibility of 
						<italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites to Glucantime.
					</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In vitro susceptibility testing was first performed on 185 isolated parasites in the intracellular mouse peritoneal macrophage model. A strong correlation between the clinical outcome and the in vitro effective concentration 50&#x00025; (EC
						<sub>50</sub>) values was observed. Parasites derived from patients with non-healing lesions had EC
						<sub>50</sub> values at least 4-fold higher than parasites derived from lesions of healing patients. A selection of these strains was typed at the molecular level by pulsed-field gels and by sequencing the pteridine reductase 1 
						<italic>(PTR1)</italic> gene. These techniques indicated that 28 out of 31 selected strains were 
						<named-content content-type="genus-species">Leishmania tropica</named-content> and that three were 
						<italic>Leishmania major.</italic> The 
						<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. major</named-content> isolates were part of a distinct pulsed-field group, and the 
						<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. tropica</named-content> isolates could be classified in three related additional pulsed-field groups. For each pulsed-field karyotype, we selected sensitive and resistant parasites in which we transfected the firefly luciferase marker to assess further the in vitro susceptibility of field isolates in the monocyte cell line THP1. These determinations confirmed unequivocally that patients with non-healing lesions were infected with 
						<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. tropica</named-content> parasites resistant to Glucantime. Additional characterization of the resistant isolates showed that resistance is stable and can be reversed by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis.

The treatment of leishmaniasis in endemic areas relies on chemotherapy, and in several parts of the world the mainstay remains the pentavalent antimony (SbV)&#x02013;containing drugs Pentostam and Glucantime. Second-line drugs such as pentamidine or liposomal amphotericin B are less useful owing to problems associated with either toxicity or cost &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

				<bold>.</bold> In 2002, an outbreak of ACL occurred in Mashhad, north-east Iran, where almost 4,900 CL cases have been detected by clinical and parasitological methods (Khorassan Health Centers Reports 2000&#x02013;2002). The results of a cross-sectional study in this area showed that 94.2&#x00025; of isolates were

The objective of this study was to determine whether clinical unresponsiveness to SbV in patients with ACL was correlated to parasites with decreased susceptibility to SbV.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the School of Public Health and Institute of Public Health Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. CL was confirmed by parasitological procedures, including observation of the amastigotes under light microscopy with high magnification (&#x000d7;1,000) and their cultivation in specific culture media. Pregnant and lactating patients were excluded from this study. Patients with previous CL history were also excluded. From the 248 patients that were initially included in the study, 185 isolates of 
					<italic>Leishmania</italic> species were collected from skin lesions (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Lesions were in general non-ulcerative (71&#x00025;), and 63&#x00025; of patients had single lesions. Patients were treated according to the physician's and/or the patient's decision either systemically, intralesionally, or, for a small number of patients, with both regimens (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The national protocol for the treatment of ACL is systemic SbV (20 mg/kg/d for 14 d), and noncompliance to this protocol is mostly induced by the patient's wish. No interference with common practice implemented in the treatment strategy was made through this study. Successful treatment was defined as complete re-epithelialization of all lesions with no relapse within 6 mo of follow up. Parasites were also collected from skin lesions which did not respond to treatment (
					<italic>n</italic> = 20, see 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were classified as nonresponders when they presented lesions at a 24-mo follow up. These patients were treated with a second course of Glucantime.

The patients were treated either systemically or intralesionally. The two treatment regimens appeared to be equally effective, with no relapse within the first 6 mo after treatment for the majority of patients (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two responding patients showed relapse after 12 mo, although no work was carried out to determine whether this represented a true relapse or a new infection. Ten patients were first treated intralesionally, but owing to the pain induced by intralesional injection, the patients preferred to receive systemic SbV and therefore received a round of systemic SbV (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, 10.8&#x00025; of patients (20 out of 185) did not respond to the first course of SbV treatment (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A slightly higher, but not significant, proportion of nonresponding patients were seen in the groups receiving intralesional treatment (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g001">Figure 1</xref>).
				</p><p>The goal of this study was to determine whether unresponsiveness to Glucantime is due to the presence of resistant parasites. The EC

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Similar infection rates were observed between parasites derived from responsive (91.3 &#x000b1; 12.9 amastigotes/100 untreated macrophages) and unresponsive (83.7 &#x000b1; 8.0 amastigotes/100 untreated macrophages) patients. The results showed a strong correlation between the clinical outcome and susceptibility values. Indeed, the 165 patients who responded to SbV treatment were infected with parasites with EC

					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the 20 primary nonresponders were infected with parasites that had considerably higher EC
					<sub>50</sub> to SbV ratios. These parasites could be identified as falling into two groups: those parasites with intermediate EC
					<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 10 to 25 &#x003bc;g/ml and those with EC

				</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Characterization of Parasites</title><p>Further characterization of the parasites was warranted since the observed differences in susceptibility values could be due to the emergence of resistant parasites or to varying clones or species with different intrinsic susceptibilities (see, for example, &#x0005b;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;). Thirty-one strains (the 20 nonresponsive and 11 responsive isolates) were characterized at the molecular level by a number of techniques. Attempts to identify the species of parasite were initially carried out using PCR typing by a RAPD technique &#x0005b;
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Unambiguous identification was reached for 18 of the 31 strains, but for the remaining isolates, identification of the species was only tentative (
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t002">Table 2</xref>). Sequencing of locus is a powerful strategy for microbial species identification, and sequencing of the 
					<italic>PTR1</italic> gene was found to be useful for molecular identification of 
					<italic>Leishmania</italic> species (M. Ouellette, unpublished data). Comparative analysis of the 
					<italic>PTR1</italic> sequences of the 31 isolates showed that most of the selected strains could be identified as

					<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. major</named-content> (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This locus-sequence technique could also resolve any ambiguous results of the PCR-RAPD assay (
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t002">Table 2</xref>).
				</p><p>A pulsed-field-gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique was used as a second strategy to characterize the 31 selected isolates, and the goal was to find susceptible and resistant parasites with similar karyotypes. Using this strategy, the 31 studied strains were categorized into four PFGE-distinct groups, the most different being group IV which comprised the 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. major</named-content> strains (
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Groups I to III consisted of

Indeed, anecdotal evidence indicates that an increasing proportion of patients with ACL are failing SbV therapy. In order to test whether resistant isolates exist, we measured the EC
				<sub>50</sub> of 185 isolates derived from patients before initiation of treatment. We found a strong correlation between the clinical outcome and the susceptibility levels of parasites (
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t001">Table 1</xref>). This correlation was highly significant (
				<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) as determined by a series of statistical analyses. 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. major</named-content> isolate No. 105, a species usually associated with ZCL, was also found to be resistant to Glucantime (

				<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. infantum</named-content> isolates, however, this correlation stands only for the short-term outcome and not for the longer-term outcome, possibly because the majority of patients included in this study were infected with HIV-1 &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The parasites derived from non-healing patients were characterized and were found to be closely related to parasites derived from susceptible patients (

				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t002">Table 2</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first detailed demonstration that resistant and sensitive clinical 
				<italic>Leishmania</italic> isolates are related and the first proven case of ACL treatment failure due to resistant parasites, strongly pointing to acquired drug resistance in these isolates.
			</p><p>Susceptibility data suggest at least two resistance mechanisms, one leading to an intermediate level of resistance (as found in the majority of the isolates) and the other leading to a high level of resistance. It remains to be explored whether intermediate resistance is a necessary step before achieving high resistance, or whether the mutations arise independently. If resistance was at one point associated with a fitness cost, it would appear that the parasite did compensate for it, since its infectiousness to macrophages was found to be comparable to its survival as an intracellular parasite. Whatever the nature of the mutation, it appears (at least in some cells) to be stable, since parasites grown for more than 20 passages in the absence of drugs still kept the same level of resistance. Similar conclusions about infectivity of resistant cells and stability of the resistance phenotype were also reached for 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. donovani</named-content> clinical isolates &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b028">28</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The stability of the resistance phenotype would rule against gene-amplification events, as amplicons present in drug-resistant parasites are usually rapidly lost during growth of the parasites in the absence of selection &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with this premise, we failed to detect gene amplification in the resistant isolates (R. Hadighi and M. Ouellette, unpublished data) when using a number of techniques enabling the detection of amplified genes &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Modulation in RNA levels are also commonly associated with drug resistance &#x0005b;

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. These changes in RNA expression are usually stable, and this type of change or a point mutation could possibly explain the resistance phenotype found in resistant isolates.
			</p><p>To correlate treatment outcome with susceptibility of the parasites, we used two models, i.e., the mouse-derived macrophages and Giemsa staining and a human monocyte cell line (THP1) and luciferase-expressing parasites. An excellent correlation was found between the two models (
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t002">Tables 2</xref> and 
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t003">3</xref>). The second assay system has obvious advantages as it neither requires animals nor involves the labor-intensive parasite staining and counting &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b020">20</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The required transfection of the parasites is now a relatively straightforward technique that does not appear to modify the properties of the parasite&#x02014;at least the ones related to macrophage infection and drug susceptibility (
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t002">Tables 2</xref> and 
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t003">3</xref>). Comparable results of susceptibility testing using transfected parasites were also obtained for

				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. The susceptibility of promastigotes to SbIII did not correlate well with intracellular SbV susceptibility data (
				<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0030162-t003">Table 3</xref>). This could be due to either different resistance mechanisms, some giving cross-resistance to SbIII, or to varying levels of intrinsic resistance. In addition, this simpler SbIII-susceptibility assay could not be used to predict clinical outcome.
			</p><p>Our report describes, in detail, several 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. tropica</named-content> and one 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. major</named-content> isolates that appear to have acquired mutations leading to decreased susceptibility to SbV and to unresponsiveness towards clinical therapy. It is salient to point out that four out of the 20 primary unresponsive patients responded to a second course of Glucantime treatment. All four harbored parasites with intermediate levels of resistance (EC
				<sub>50</sub> 10&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;g/ml). The next challenge will be to determine the exact molecular mechanisms of resistance. It is possible that, as in the in vitro isolates, thiols are important for the resistance phenotype (
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030162-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, preliminary results suggest that glutathione levels are higher in some resistant isolates (G. Roy and M. Ouellette, unpublished data). This suggests a strategy of using drug combinations to reverse drug resistance in the field. Ongoing studies should lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of antimony resistance in field isolates.
			</p><p>The equation between chemotherapeutic resistance (either in infectious diseases or oncology), as determined by in vitro testing, and treatment failure is intuitively expected but in some occasions this is still unclear. For example, in the case of pneumonia caused by 
				<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</italic> often in vitro findings do not appear to be predictive of in vivo outcome, except with the most highly resistant bacteria (reviewed in &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;). However, several reports indicate that an increase in drug resistance is associated with an increased treatment failure (reviewed in &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b054">54</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;). Failure in SbV treatment in 
				<italic>Leishmania</italic> has been attributed to several factors other than resistant parasites, including host immunological status, suboptimal treatment, and pharmacokinetic properties &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b040">40</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, but it is now clear that an increase in resistance can lead to treatment failure for both visceral leishmaniasis &#x0005b;
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030162-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and CL. Future work should lead to a precise understanding of the resistance mechanisms in field isolates, which should lead to strategies for rapidly diagnosing resistance in order to improve the clinical management of leishmaniasis.

							<italic>Leishmania</italic> group of parasites. The diseases are common in many tropical and subtropical areas, where patients are infected through the bite of sandflies that had previously bitten an infected animal or human. The most common form of the disease is cutaneous leishmaniasis, characterized by skin ulcers that take months to heal and often leave ugly and disabling scars. They can also lead to secondary, more dangerous, infections. In most parts of the world, so-called pentavalent antimonials are the drug of choice. Over the past few years, these drugs are becoming less and less effective against the disease, with increasing numbers of patients not responding, showing only partial recovery, or needing higher doses of the drugs to get better. A few additional drugs are now available and are being developed, but some are expensive and others have serious side effects.
						</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>There are several possible explanations as to why the pentavalent antimonials are becoming less effective: parasites could have become increasingly resistant to the drugs, the patients' immune systems could have become weaker over time, or different strains of parasites against which the drugs are not as effective could be responsible for more of the recent cases. It is important for health officials to know which of these apply when they decide on strategies to improve the situation. Results from north-east India, where 
							<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. donovani</named-content> is the predominant cause of the disease, suggest that the parasites are becoming resistant. The scientists who did this study wanted to find out which of these possibilities might be true in Iran, a country in which cutaneous leishmaniasis is common.
						</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They discussed the study with many patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis in Mashad, an area in Iran where the disease is common. Of those patients, 248 were suitable and agreed to participate. The researchers then isolated parasites from 185 different ulcerous wounds, including 20 from patients who did not respond well to treatment with pentavalent antimonials. They studied these parasites in various ways. They found that all of the parasites from the 20 nonresponsive patients were either partially or fully resistant to the drugs, meaning that either higher doses of drugs were necessary or that even very high doses could not kill the parasites. They then wanted to know which 
							<italic>Leishmania</italic> species the responsive and nonresponsive parasites belonged to. To answer this question, they determined the genetic code for one specific gene which is known to have different versions in different species. This showed that 19 of the unresponsive isolates belonged to

						</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The results show that 
							<named-content content-type="genus-species">L. tropica</named-content> parasites can become resistant to pentavalent antimonials. They also suggest that such resistant strains are largely responsible for the decreased effectiveness of these drugs against cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iran. This means that Iran and other countries where resistance is becoming more common need to develop treatment strategies for patients who do not respond to pentavalent antimonials. For researchers, the goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance so that they can be taken into account when advising on alternative therapies and developing new drugs against the leishmaniases.
