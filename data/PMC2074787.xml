Seventy-four patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer (36 squamous cell, 38 adenocarcinoma) were treated with a combination of 10 Gy HDR brachytherapy, followed by 40 Gy in 4 weeks external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), starting 2 weeks later. Tumour response, as measured by endoscopy and/or barium swallow, revealed complete remission in 21 and partial response in 38 patients (overall response rate 80%). Improvement of dysphagia was induced by brachytherapy within a few days in 39%, and achieved at the end of treatment in 70% of patients. Further weight loss was prevented in 39 of the 59 patients who presented with weight loss. Pain at presentation improved in 12 out of 25 patients. Median survival was 9 months. No differences in either response rate or survival were found in squamous cell or adenocarcinoma. Side-effects were either acute with minimal discomfort in 32 (42%) or late with painful ulceration in five patients (7%), occurring after a median of 4 months. A fistula developed in six patients, all with concurrent tumour. In conclusion, brachytherapy before EBRT was a safe and effective procedure to induce rapid relief of dysphagia, especially when combined with EBRT.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0130-a" xlink:role="1454"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0131-a" xlink:role="1455"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1452" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1453" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1454" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1455" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1456" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00025-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1457" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
