Expression of Bcl-2 was determined using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections in a series of 441 premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancers of patients randomised to receive perioperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or no perioperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of Bcl-2 was evaluated by scoring both staining intensity (0-3) and number of positive cells (0-2). Using these scores tumours were grouped into categories 0-6. It was found that 9.2% of the tumours were completely negative (0), 17.2% weakly (1 + 2), 41.6% moderately (3 + 4) and 31.9% strongly positive (5 + 6) for Bcl-2. A positive correlation was found between high Bcl-2 expression and oestrogen (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and progesterone receptor positivity (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and low tumour grade (P &#x0003c; 0.001), whereas high Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with p53 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and c-erb-B-2 positively (P &#x0003c; 0.001), high Ki-67 index (P &#x0003c; 0.001), mitotic index (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and large tumour size (P = 0.006). Patients with tumours expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (overall score 3-6) had a significantly better disease-free (P = 0.004) and overall (P = 0.009) survival. However, in a multivariate model this association no longer remained significant. There was a trend for an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival both for patients with Bcl-2-positive (HR-0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.06, P = 0.07) and negative (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.27-1.12, P = 0.09) breast tumours at a median follow-up of 49 months. The level of Bcl-2 expression does not seem to predict response to perioperative chemotherapy in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. High levels of Bcl-2 are preferentially expressed in well-differentiated tumours and are associated with favourable prognosis. However, Bcl-2 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in this patient series.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0084-a" xlink:role="80"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="78" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="79" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="80" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="81" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="82" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="83" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="84" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00017-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="85" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
