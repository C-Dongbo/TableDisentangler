Forty-six patients entered a phase II study of ZD1694 in advanced breast cancer. A total of 74% of patients had received prior systemic therapy (either as adjuvant cytotoxic or hormonal therapy or hormone therapy for advanced disease); 39% had received prior adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy. All patients had measurable disease and 50% had liver metastases. In all 43 patients were evaluable for response. Of these patients 26% achieved complete (CR) or partial response (PR) (95% Cl 14-42%). A response rate of 44% was seen in liver metastases. Two patients achieved CR of 265 and 301 days' duration respectively, one in locoregional disease, and one in liver metastases. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were nausea and vomiting (11%), diarrhoea (11%) and leucopenia (20%). Grade 3/4, self-limited and reversible increases in transaminases were seen in 22% of patients. ZD1694 has useful single agent activity in patients with hormone-refractory advanced breast cancer, comparable with that reported for other anti-metabolites, with acceptable tolerability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00019-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="479" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00019-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="480" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00019-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="481" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
