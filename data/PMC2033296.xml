In a non-randomised study, 22 patients with SCLC of limited extent and good performance status were prescribed six cycles of etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide at 4 week intervals with doses of thoracic radiotherapy following the second, third and fourth cycles. Although only six patients received all their prescribed treatment, nine (41%) were alive at 1 year, seven (32%) at 2 years, six (27%) at 3 years, and four are still alive at, respectively, 42, 47, 50, and 61 months, all four being in the subgroup of eight patients with WHO performance status grade 0 at the start of treatment. In a comparison with similar patients receiving conventionally scheduled chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a concurrent trial, no difference in survival was seen in the patients with performance status grade 1 or 2, but a large difference in favour of the alternating schedule in those with grade 0 status was seen. We encourage other investigators to report the results achieved with intensive treatment in patients with WHO grade 0 performance status at the start of treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="142" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="143" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00053-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="144" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
