Trials were selected which published data on survival, time to treatment failure and response rate. This study suggests that dox confers advantages on all of these endpoints and that the size of such benefits needs to be taken into account when deciding whether to use dox.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00206-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="801" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00206-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="802" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00206-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="803" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00206-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="804" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00206-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="805" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
