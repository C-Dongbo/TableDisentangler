All these patients showed a lung shunting below 15% and a tumour-to-normal ratio higher than 2 as determined by diagnostic technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-MAA) gamma scintigraphy. The treatment was given through an arterial port placed during laparotomy. The radiation doses to the liver and tumour were determined intraoperatively with a beta probe and liquid scintillation counting of multiple liver biopsies. The treatment was well tolerated without major complications. In all patients the tumour marker fell to a level which ranged from 41% to 0.2% of the pretreatment level. Tumour regression was found to be dose related. Progressive or static disease occurred in a higher proportion of patients whose tumours received &#x0003c; 120 Gy (P = 0.005). Survival was better in those whose tumours received &#x0003e; 120 Gy (median survival = 55.9 weeks) than those whose tumours received lower doses (median survival = 26.2 weeks). This difference is statistically significant with P = 0.005. We conclude that yttrium-90 microsphere therapy is safe and that tumour response is dose related. A tumour dose of &#x0003e; 120 Gy is recommended.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="994" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0217.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="995" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0218.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="996" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0219.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="997" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0220.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="998" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00057-0221.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="999" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
