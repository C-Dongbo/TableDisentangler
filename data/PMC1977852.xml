Records of 928 out of 990 deaths were available for review but were very variable in quality. Definite errors were found in 1%, errors were suspected in a further 5% and uncertainty about the cause of death, despite review, was recorded for 27%. The overall bias in reporting breast cancer deaths was less than 1%. It was concluded that the certified underlying cause of death without review provides an adequate endpoint for evaluating breast cancer screening programmes in the UK.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1151" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1152" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1153" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1154" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1155" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00076-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1156" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
