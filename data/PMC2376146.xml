The most promising drug under study is gemcitabine, a relatively new antimetabolite that represents an attractive candidate for combination chemotherapy because of its excellent side-effect profile and the absence of overlapping toxicities with other chemotherapeutic agents. Combined administration of gemcitabine and anthracyclines could result in the induction of DNA breaks that are not easily repaired by the cell's machinery, thus enhancing the apoptotic signals triggered by these lesions. Forty-four patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this multicenter study. Patients received Epirubicin 20&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest (1 cycle) and gemcitabine 1000&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> after Epirubicin on the same day. All were assessable for toxicity and response, 11 patients responded to treatment with one complete response and 10 partial responses, for an overall response rate of 25&#x00025;. Median survival was 10.9 months (range, 2&#x02013;26 months). Therapy was well tolerated, with a low incidence of haematologic grade &#x0003e;2 toxicity. A total of 12 of 27 (44.4&#x00025;) eligible patients attained a clinical benefit response. Our findings suggest that the gemcitabine-epirubicin schedule is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>87</bold>, 497&#x02013;501. doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1038/sj.bjc.6600482">10.1038/sj.bjc.6600482</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="www.bjcancer.com">www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p><p>&#x000a9; 2002 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.crc.org.uk">Cancer Research UK</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>clinical benefit</kwd><kwd>epirubicin (EPI)</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine (GEM)</kwd><kwd>tumour response</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title/><p>Locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and rapidly fatal disease that represents the fifth most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and Europe (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Jensen <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Parker <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Although advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of many gastrointestinal malignancies, no such progress has been made in pancreatic cancer. Consequently, median survival from the time of diagnosis ranges from 3 to 6 months for patients with unresectable disease (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Brennan <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Treatment with single-agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) produces tumour response rates in the range of 0&#x02013;20&#x00025;, with little additional response when used in combination therapy, and no impact on survival (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Brennan <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the combination of chemotherapy with radiotherapy has not gained much support (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Klaassen <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>). These disappointing results underline the need for new active agents in pancreatic cancer. Among these, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, and temozolomide have shown only limited activity, with response rates of 5&#x02013;17&#x00025; in phase II studies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">van Riel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). In contrast, gemcitabine (GEM), a relatively new nucleoside antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis through a number of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Heinemann <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Heinemann <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), appears to have different properties and activity across a broad range of solid tumours. In particular, GEM has been more effective than 5-FU in the alleviation of some disease-related symptoms and prolongation of survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Burris <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of preclinical studies, GEM represents an attractive candidate for combination chemotherapy because of its excellent side-effect profile and the absence of overlapping toxicities with other chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, due to its chain termination masking activity, GEM directly inhibits DNA repair (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">van Moorsel <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>), which could represent a molecular basis for synergistic activity with other DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>Two of the most potent and widely used DNA-damaging anticancer drugs are doxorubicin and its derivative epirubicin (EPI), whose primary mechanism of action, as with other anthracycline derivatives, is the inhibition of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA resealing and the production of stable DNA breakage. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies in solid tumor cell lines have demonstrated that pretreatment of cancer cells with doxorubicin, followed by administration of GEM, inhibits proliferation and increases the rate of DNA fragmentation. Thus, the combined administration of GEM and anthracyclines could result in the induction of DNA breaks, which are not easily repaired by the cell's machinery, thereby enhancing the apoptotic signals triggered by these lesions (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Angelucci <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). These data suggest that a treatment schedule of an anthracycline derivative (EPI) in combination with GEM treatment may be of great therapeutic value in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, because advanced-stage pancreatic cancer is frequently accompanied by debilitating symptoms (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Schnall and Macdonald, 1996</xref>), we designed a phase II trial to quantify the effect of GEM-EPI administration on clinical benefit response as well as objective responses and median survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Patients eligible for the trial had a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic bidimensionally measurable disease.

Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan were performed to define the measurable lesions before the start of treatment, every two cycles to evaluate response and after the seven cycle. Baseline performance status, analgesic consumption, and pain intensity data were also collected.</p><p>Objective tumour assessments and evaluation of clinical benefit response, a composite measure of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), performance status, and body weight (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Burris <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>), were determined at the end of every 2 cycles during chemotherapy and every 3 months after discontinuation of treatment. Tumour measurements were based on the sum of the products of the bidimensional diameter of the lesions. To be classified as a complete responder (CR), a patient had to have complete regression of the disease and be free of symptoms related to the carcinoma for a minimum of 4 weeks. Patients with greater than a 50&#x00025; reduction in lesion size and no new lesions were classified as partial responders (PR) and minor response for reduction in lesion size &#x0003c;50&#x00025;. Patients were rated as having progressive disease (PD) if any new lesion appeared, if tumour size increased by 25&#x00025; over pretreatment measurements, or for deterioration in clinical status consistent with disease progression. Patients who failed to meet the criteria of CR, PR, or PD, and who remained on-study for at least 2 months, were classified as having stable disease (SD). Two objective measurements that showed a response at least 4-week intervals were required to confirm a patients' response and were assessed by CT and/or abdominal ultrasound examination: all tumour measurements in patients who responded were reviewed and confirmed by an independent radiologist blinded to the sequencing of the scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical benefit response criteria</title><p>Clinical benefit assessments included evaluations of pain intensity, analgesic consumption, performance status, and weight (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Rothenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Burris <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). Analgesic consumption was computed on a weekly basis as the mean of the daily analgesic consumption, expressed in terms of morphine equivalent mg day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. To be considered clinical benefit responders, patients had to have more than 1 of the following: a 50&#x00025; decrease in pain intensity; a 50&#x00025; decrease in analgesic consumption; or a &#x0003e;20-point increase in performance status that was sustained for more than 4 weeks, without deterioration in any of the other parameters. For patients who were stable in pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and performance status, a 7&#x00025; increase in dry body weight was required for patients to be classified responders. During the study, pain intensity was measured daily by the patients using a 10-cm linear analog scale, and analgesic consumption was based on a daily diary kept by patients. Performance status and weight were measured weekly by a nurse. Each patient was classified as positive, stable, or negative for each of the primary clinical benefit measures.

As with other gastrointestinal malignancies, 5-FU is the most widely investigated agent and produces tumour response rates ranging from 0&#x02013;20&#x00025; and median survival times of 4.2&#x02013;5.5 months (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Brennan <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). Modulation by folinic acid, protracted venous infusion, or timing with circadian rhythms seem to have only marginal effects on response rates and survival. Recent phase II studies have reported promising clinical activity with the combination of GEM and anthracycline derivatives in advanced breast and non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Lueftner <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">van Putten <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In a phase II trial by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Scheithauer <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>, 70 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma received 4 weekly courses of GEM 1000&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15 plus EPI 60&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> on day 1. Out of the 66 patients evaluable for response, there was an overall objective response rate of 21&#x00025; (1 CR, 13 PR). Median survival was 7.8 months. We therefore decided to combine GEM and EPI, as proposed by Scheithauer, but with a different schedule. In our trial, patients received a weekly administration of GEM plus EPI once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in an attempt to exploit the synergistic action of the two drugs while minimizing the overall toxicity. This regimen was associated with promising activity in our patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Twenty-five per cent of patients attained an objective response, and median survival for responding and nonresponding patients combined was 10.9 months. Recently, there has been renewed interest in single&#x02013;agent chemotherapy with the advent of novel agents such as irinotecan (response rate 11&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Sakata <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>) and docetaxel (response rate 20&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Androulakis <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Single-agent GEM has also been recently investigated for activity as well as toxicity in advanced pancreatic cancer by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Casper <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Carmichael <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, who reported modest objective response rates of 6.3&#x02013;11&#x00025; and median survivals of 5.6&#x02013;6.3 months; however, the symptomatic improvements were greater than the objective tumour response rates would suggest. Consequently, the National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration (USA) have accepted that the relief of tumour-related symptoms is itself a noteworthy goal of carcinoma treatment (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">O'Shaughnessy <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). Given the palliative nature of advanced disease, we reasoned that pancreatic carcinoma offered an appropriate clinical setting in which to examine these alternative endpoints. Thus, the current study evaluated clinical benefit response as an endpoint of efficacy. We observed a palliative effect in 44&#x00025; of symptomatic patients; a similar rate (43&#x00025;) was reported by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Scheithauer <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>. Yet, consistent with <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Hidalgo <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; half of patients who attained clinical benefit did not achieve an objective tumour response.</p><p>The results of this study also clearly demonstrated that the GEM-EPI regimen was adequately tolerated, and was associated with moderate toxic effects that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those reported in other malignancies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Lueftner <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">van Putten <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Leukopenia WHO grade 3 was observed in 14&#x00025; of patients; however, there were no episodes of febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization. Other common nonhaematological toxicities such as nausea/vomiting and alopecia were mild, and we did not observe any cardiac toxicity at this dose of EPI.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that weekly GEM plus EPI is well tolerated and confirms the observation of symptomatic improvement in a reasonable proportion of patients with advanced disease. In addition, the regimen is active with a good response rate, and a long median survival duration. Our future efforts will focus on randomized trials evaluating this GEM-EPI schedule in patients with earlier-stage disease and/or as adjuvant chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all those who have assisted us in this study, especially Dr Eda Berger.
