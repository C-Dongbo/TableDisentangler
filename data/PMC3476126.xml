duration of preventive treatment for
migraine is 3&#x02013;6 months. Our aim
was to explore how many patients
attending a specialised clinic need
prolonged preventive treatment for
longer than one year. Eighty consecutive
migraine patients who
received preventive treatment with
topiramate for 3 months with good
response and tolerability were
included in this observational study.
All patients continued on topiramate
until they had completed 6 months,
when this drug was stopped.
Topiramate was reintroduced if
there was a worsening. Topiramate
was kept for 6 more months and
then discontinued again. Those
patients whose headaches became
worse after this second withdrawal
received topiramate again and were
followed-up for at least half a year.
Headaches did not worsen after the
first withdrawal at 6 months in 40
patients (50%), while they clearly
worsened in the remaining 40
patients. At the end of the first year
only two patients out of these 40
(5%) discontinued topiramate and
did not notice an increase in
headache frequency after two
months. In conclusion, around half
of the patients attending a specialised
clinic due to frequent
headache need preventive treatment
for more than one year. Our data
suggest that the current practice recommending
periods of preventive
treatment of 3&#x02013;6 months should be
reconsidered for many patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Preventive
