BIS-1 is directed against both the CD3 antigen on T cells and the EGP-2 molecule on carcinoma cells and some normal epithelia. The amount of BIS-1 F(ab')2 bound to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) increased dose-dependently. This occupation degree was highest at the end of the 2 h infusion and rapidly decreased subsequently. During the first hour of BIS-1 F(ab')2 infusion the number of PBLs decreased slowly. This was followed by an increase in serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and a rapid decrease in the numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils. In our view, the most likely explanation for the observed decrease in occupation degree of BIS-1 F(ab')2 and the rise in TNF-alpha levels is based on the assumption that BIS-1-carrying T cells leave the circulation. The CD3 antigens on these extravasated T cells become cross-linked by EGP-2 antigens, inducing TNF-alpha secretion. This results in an enhanced decrease in the numbers of PBLs, monocytes and eosinophils. These preliminary results suggest that BIS-1 F(ab')2 treatment during IL-2 therapy may induce local T-cell activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00043-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="795" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00043-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="796" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00043-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="797" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00043-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="798" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00043-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="799" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
