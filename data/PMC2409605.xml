Goserelin alone has been shown to produce castrate levels of oestradiol (E2) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Williams <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>) and response rates similar to oophorectomy in premenopausal women both in Phase II studies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Blamey <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>) and in a randomised study (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). An early nonrandomised clinical study suggested possible extension of the duration of response upon addition of the antioestrogen tamoxifen to goserelin in premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). More recently, a meta-analysis of four studies has revealed that using the combination of goserelin and tamoxifen as initial therapy produced a significantly longer time to first progression than using goserelin alone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Klijn <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The rationale for this therapy is that, having effectively rendered the patient postmenopausal with the use of goserelin, the effect of peripheral E2 production in promoting hormone-sensitive breast cancer growth is inhibited by tamoxifen, as in postmenopausal women. Indeed, the combination of goserelin and tamoxifen has been shown to produce a significantly lower concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than goserelin alone, and a resultant (nonsignificant) reduction in E2 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 1989a</xref>).</p><p>Selective aromatase inhibitors (e.g. anastrozole (Arimidex, AstraZeneca)) have now become the standard second-line endocrine therapy, after the failure of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Buzdar <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).

Therefore, following the same logic that has led to the combined use of goserelin and tamoxifen, we now report clinical and endocrine data supporting the use of goserelin combined with anastrozole for premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, who have progressed following treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>All premenopausal women who had been treated with goserelin and anastrozole for advanced breast cancer in the Nottingham Breast Unit were included in the study.

All of them had histologically proven breast cancer, and were treated in a dedicated Advanced Breast Cancer Clinic. They had all previously been treated with goserelin and tamoxifen, and had had a clinical benefit (see below). The median duration of partial response (PR) on goserelin and tamoxifen was 52.5 months (range 27&#x02013;59 months), and that of durable stable disease (SD) was 23 months (range 10&#x02013;84 months). The indications for treatment were metastatic disease (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13) or locally advanced primary breast cancer. In all, 14 patients had oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumours. One had ER-negative tumour and one unknown ER status. Progesterone receptor status was not routinely done in this unit.</p><p>The treatment was changed to goserelin and anastrozole at the time of disease progression.

Agents are used sequentially, for example, Tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole. Sequential hormone treatments for premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer are less established. Ovarian ablation (e.g. oophorectomy or irradiation) has been used for over 100 years since Beatson first reported response to surgical oophorectomy in a patient with advanced breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Beatson 1896</xref>). Much more recently, ovarian suppression with GnRH agonist (e.g. goserelin) has been reported to produce response rates similar to ovarian ablation both in phase II studies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Blamey <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>) and in a multicentre randomised trial (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Furthermore treatment with goserelin has been shown to result in castrate levels of E2 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Nicholson <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Tamoxifen is a well-established first-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Megestrol acetate was the standard second-line endocrine agent after failing tamoxifen, and has now been replaced by selective aromatase inhibitors (e.g. anastrozole) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Buzdar <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Recent data have shown at least equivalent effects between tamoxifen and anastrozole as first-line endocrine therapy (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Bonneterre <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Nabholtz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The time to progression was found to be significantly longer in patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen in some of these randomised trials (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Nabholtz <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Milla-Santos <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Similar results were also seen with other third-generation aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Mouridsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The induction of menopause using goserelin and its combination with tamoxifen is a rational extension for treating premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Klijn <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). It has been demonstrated to produce a significant OR rate of worthwhile duration. Further extension of treatment regimes in premenopausal women has led to the substitution of tamoxifen by a selective aromatase inhibitor (e.g. anastrozole) on progression of disease, just as in postmenopausal women.</p><sec><title>Clinical response</title><p>The results reported here show that further significant remission of worthwhile duration can be achieved using anastrozole in combination with goserelin, after tamoxifen has ceased to be effective. Clinical benefit was achieved in 12 out of 16 patients (75&#x00025;) at 6 months, with a median duration of therapy of 17&#x0002b; months. One of the four patients who progressed before 6 months was in fact offered chemotherapy as the treatment of choice for her liver metastases, but she refused and requested to be put on endocrine therapy. It would therefore appear that the response rate might be higher if only patients who had endocrine therapy as the appropriate treatment option were included. Although the number of patients in this series is small, the response rate has far exceeded that of traditional second-line endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women (our previous study has shown an OR&#x0002b;SD rate of 53&#x00025; using megestrol acetate, with a median duration of response of 15 months (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Cheung <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>)). The result in the present study represents a significant extension of disease control after progression on prior goserelin and tamoxifen, and compares favourably to the use of anastrozole in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Wiseman and Adkins, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Patients in this study all had previously responded to goserelin and tamoxifen with a clinical benefit. However, it should be noted that the type of response is lower than that achieved with goserelin and tamoxifen. In the 16 patients studied, treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen resulted in one CR, five PRs and 10 SDs at 6 months. At progression, when tamoxifen was substituted by anastrozole, only one patient achieved a PR, with nine having SD. There were two patients with non-PD, as assessed by tumour marker response. There were no patients who achieved a CR. This finding is expected, as it is well known that response rates fall with each sequential endocrine manoeuvre, although the durable SD rate remains high. It must be noted that, despite a lower CR&#x0002f;PR rate, the clinical benefit rate (CR&#x0002f;PR&#x0002f;SD) was high, and it has been established that patients who have achieved SD for 6 months on an endocrine therapy have survival equivalent to those with CR&#x0002f;PR (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Howell <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">1989b</xref>). A similar effect was also seen in the duration of response, which again became shortened with second-line endocrine therapy using goserelin and anastrozole.</p></sec><sec><title>Endocrine response</title><p>The results for the different hormones assayed will be considered in turn. Oestradiol levels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> confirm that castrate levels can be achieved with the introduction of goserelin, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 1989a</xref>). There was, however, a further 76&#x00025; fall (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) in E2 levels when tamoxifen was substituted by anastrozole (from 23.6 to 6.96&#x02009;pmol&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). This was associated with a good clinical response, as shown above. There were no peaks of E2 activity noted in any of the serum samples.</p><p>Follicle-stimulating hormone levels were initially suppressed by treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen. Again, this is consistent with results previously seen (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 1989a</xref>). However, substitution of tamoxifen by anastrozole led to a partial loss of this suppression, with FSH levels rising towards pretreatment values. This may be due to the effect of a negative feedback as a result of further reduction in E2 levels upon the introduction of an aromatase inhibitor. It may also be a rebound phenomenon from coming off tamoxifen.</p><p>Luteinising hormone levels were suppressed, as would be expected by constant administration of a GnRH analogue. There was no significant change in LH levels on goserelin plus anastrozole.</p><p>Testosterone levels were unchanged by treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen. Substitution of tamoxifen by anastrozole produced a 20&#x00025; fall in testosterone levels (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Androstenedione levels were also unchanged by treatment with goserelin and tamoxifen. Again, as with testosterone, there was a significant but small fall in hormone levels when tamoxifen was substituted by anastrozole &#x02013; 18&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02). The levels of DHES were unaltered by treatment with either combination. It would appear that these substrates for aromatase (i.e. the precursors from which E2 is converted) do not increase with a blockade of the conversion system by the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (e.g. anastrozole).</p><p>This study has a relatively small number of patients and short overall follow-up to date. Nevertheless, it is the first study reporting on the clinical and endocrine effects of the combined use of goserelin and anastrozole as a second-line endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. The endocrine changes are more interesting by having similar data from the same patients, while they received goserelin and tamoxifen as first-line endocrine therapy. The combination of goserelin and anastrozole produces a significant clinical benefit rate, which is also of worthwhile duration in this group of patients. Such combination therefore offers a clinically valuable therapeutic option. Further studies involving a larger number of patients and longer duration of follow-up are indicated. Such evaluation now appears to be of paramount importance, as the selective aromatase inhibitors (eg anastrozole) have recently been shown to be the preferred first-line endocrine therapy to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
