A possible imbalance or deficiency of essential fatty acids is suggested by reported beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation. To assess fatty acid status (composition of plasma and neutrophil phospholipids) in advanced cancer patients before and after 14 days of supplementation (12&#x000b1;1&#x02009;g&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) with fish (eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo (olive) oil. Blood was drawn from cancer patients experiencing weight loss of &#x0003e;5&#x00025; body weight (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;23). Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and the major phospholipid classes of isolated neutrophils were determined using gas liquid chromatography. At baseline, patients with advanced cancer exhibited low levels (&#x0003c;30&#x00025; of normal values) of plasma phospholipids and constituent fatty acids and elevated 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 content in neutrophil phospholipids. High <italic>n</italic>-6/<italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid ratios in neutrophil and plasma phospholipids were inversely related to body mass index. Fish oil supplementation raised eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid content in plasma but not neutrophil phospholipids. 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 content was reduced in neutrophil PI following supplementation with fish oil. Change in body weight during the supplementation period related directly to increases in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma. Advanced cancer patients have alterations in lipid metabolism potentially due to nutritional status and/or chemotherapy. Potential obstacles in fatty acid utilisation must be addressed in future trials aiming to improve outcomes using nutritional intervention with fish oils.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>87</bold>, 1370&#x02013;1378. doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="10.1038/sj.bjc.6600659">10.1038/sj.bjc.6600659</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="www.bjcancer.com">www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.crc.org.uk">&#x000a9; 2002 Cancer Research UK</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>weight loss</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>phospholipids</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>nutritional status</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title/><p>Dietary supplementation with the <italic>n</italic>-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) as either fish oil capsules or a fish oil- supplemented enteral formula has been reported to attenuate weight loss, increase appetite, improve quality of life and prolong survival in weight losing cancer patients (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib64">Wigmore <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib63">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib65">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Barber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Beneficial effects of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid supplementation imply the presence of an imbalance between essential <italic>n</italic>-6 and <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids or a deficiency of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids. Indices of fatty acid status may have prognostic value for selecting patients likely to obtain benefits from supplementation, however, to date supplementation has not been prospectively examined based on determined fatty acid status. Detailed indices of fatty acid status are also of interest for assessing the efficacy of supplementation protocols.</p><p>The fatty acid status of patients with advanced cancer is not well characterised. There is some evidence for abnormalities in lipid metabolism, including increased lipolysis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib33">Kitada <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib56">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>) and oxidation of free fatty acids, (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib29">Hansell <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Douglas and Shaw, 1990</xref>) and hyper-triglyceridemia (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Grunfeld and Feingold, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib58">Tisdale, 1999</xref>). Abnormalities of plasma lipid profiles of cancer patients compared to healthy individuals have been reported (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib43">Mcclinton <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, many drug agents used to treat cancer have been reported to influence lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Ara and Teicher, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipid (PL) and different cell types (erythrocytes, neutrophils) reflect, respectively, short and long term patterns of dietary fatty acid consumption, and are frequently used as indices of fatty acid status (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Clandinin <italic>et al</italic>, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib55">Stanford <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Diboune <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib48">Pratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Neutrophils are of particular interest as these cells have been implicated in several disease states with an inflammatory component (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib54">Sperling <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib41">Matzner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib40">Matsukawa and Yoshinaga, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Ambrosio and Tritto, 1999</xref>). Neutrophils secrete and respond to several cytokines involved in the wasting response of cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Cassatella <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>) which are attenuated by dietary fish oils (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Blok <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Barber <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, major neutrophil functions are membrane dependent (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Deitch, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">de Pablo and Alvarez de Cienfuegos, 2000</xref>). Therefore, the ability to alter the membrane composition of neutrophils by fish oil supplementation may have important implications for reducing inflammation and wasting in advanced cancer patients.</p><p>The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the fatty acid composition of plasma and neutrophil PL of patients with advanced cancer and to compare this with other patient groups and healthy subjects; (2) to assess <italic>n</italic>-6 and <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid content and extent of incorporation of supplemented oils into plasma and neutrophil PL in patients with advanced cancer, and (3) to identify relationships among <italic>n</italic>-6 and <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in plasma and cell PL and some select parameters of nutritional status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>H-plates and G-plates were purchased from Analtech (Newark, DE, USA).

All subjects gave informed consent. Due to the paucity of reference data for fatty acid composition of plasma and immune cells in advanced cancer patients, multiple subject groups were selected for comparison. We compared patients with advanced cancer to victims of major burn injury, which characteristically have a very strong inflammatory reaction and marked changes in phospholipids (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib48">Pratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) as well as a group of breast cancer patients receiving high dose chemotherapy to assess the effect of chemotherapy on fatty acids. Each group of subjects had plasma and cellular PL compositions assessed using the same method in the same laboratory as the advanced cancer group. In the absence of a large base of reference data, these patient groups, which represent a wide range of patient groups from critically ill to healthy subjects, were used to obtain a context for the range of plasma PL fatty acids observed in advanced cancer patients in this study. A group of healthy subjects from the local population served as a control comparison to provide reference values for the healthy population as an age and sex matched control cohort was not feasible.</p><sec><title>Advanced cancer</title><p>Patients with advanced cancer (defined as locally recurrent or metastatic) were recruited from the Acute Palliative Care Unit and Hospice, Caritas Health Group, and both hospitalised and outpatients at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada).

Chemotherapy and burn patient groups were not compared statistically to the advanced cancer patients because they were not controlled cohorts for sex, age or body composition. The most striking observation from this analysis was that total plasma PL and most individual fatty acids in the PL of advanced cancer patients, including the essential fatty acids, 18&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;2 <italic>n</italic>-6 and 18&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;3 <italic>n</italic>-3, were the lowest of all groups studied at &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the levels observed in healthy subjects (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), only EPA levels were relatively well-maintained (93&#x00025; of healthy controls) in the advanced cancer group. The ratio of mead acid (20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;3 <italic>n</italic>-9) to 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6, a measure of essential fatty acid deficiencies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib53">Spector, 2000</xref>), was elevated in the advanced cancer patients (0.3&#x000b1;0.04) compared to healthy subjects (mean&#x0003d;0.01&#x000b1;0.0). Twelve days after major burn injury, levels of total plasma PL and most fatty acids therein were intermediate between healthy subjects and patients with advanced cancer and at 7 weeks postburn, plasma PL increased towards levels seen in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib48">Pratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). The chemotherapy group fell intermediate between the levels seen in healthy subjects and the patients with advanced cancer for most fatty acids.

We observed very low levels of plasma total PL and unusual fatty acid content of neutrophil membrane PL that was marked by elevated levels of 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6. Oral supplementation with fish oil for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in plasma PL levels of EPA and DHA, but did not alter total PL concentration in plasma nor did it raise <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid content in neutrophil PL. These results suggest multiple alterations in metabolism of lipids and specific fatty acids in cancer patients. While the causes of fatty acid abnormalities in advanced cancer have not been clearly characterised, the findings in this preliminary study in a small group of advanced cancer patients advance current understanding by outlining relationships linking fatty acid status and weight loss, as well as identifying potential causes of altered fatty acid profiles and obstacles that may impede lipid supplementation.</p><p>There is very little available data on the fatty acid status of patients with advanced cancer. Our context for comparison included healthy adults as well as additional patient groups from the same local population who had major burn injury (inflammatory injury; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib62">Tredget and Yu, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Foex and Shelly, 1996</xref>) or were undergoing chemotherapy. The results presented here represent an initial approach and it is necessary to employ caution in comparing the data obtained for cancer patients with the other patient groups which serve mainly to place the advanced cancer patients in a context for discussion. Within the limitations of these comparisons, a number of points merit attention. Firstly, patients with advanced cancer had very low levels of plasma PL. Other studies on lipid supplementation reported the fraction of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in plasma PL, but not the plasma PL levels (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib64">Wigmore <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib63">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Barber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), so this abnormality was previously undetected. The cause(s) or the point in time that low levels of plasma PL evolved has not been identified, therefore it would seem important to follow this variable in newly diagnosed patients over the disease trajectory in further studies. Our data suggests chemotherapy as one possible cause for low levels of plasma PL. The inflammatory response, reported to occur in advanced cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib58">Tisdale, 1999</xref>), may also contribute to reduced levels of plasma PL as patients with major burn injury had low plasma PL (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib48">Pratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) although to a lesser extent than the advanced cancer patients. High density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL), which account for the majority of total PL in plasma, have been recently reported to be reduced in a large, mixed group of cancer patients compared to non-cancer subjects (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Fiorenza <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), and these may account in part for the low levels of total PL observed here. Both HDL and LDL levels would be affected by a proximal deficit in lipid absorption or of chylomicron or VLDL synthesis, and studies of lipid incorporation in advanced cancer patients would appear warranted.</p><p>A second unusual observation was high <italic>n</italic>-6/<italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid ratios in plasma and cell PL of patients with advanced cancer, with an especially high fraction of 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 in all PL classes of neutrophils. It is not clear whether altered diet or altered metabolism of fatty acids would account for these differences, nor is it known to what extent the disease and therapy might have contributed. Subjects with the lowest BMIs exhibited higher levels of <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty acids in neutrophil PL and higher <italic>n</italic>-6/<italic>n</italic>-3 ratios in both plasma and neutrophil PL. This observation is consistent with the rationale given for <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid supplementation; i.e. that <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty acids are permissive for the action of catabolic mediators (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Barber, 2001</xref>). However, while high levels of <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty acids were associated with BMI, it is not clear whether this was a cause or a consequence of the wasting process. BMI is commonly used to stratify patients in trials of anorexia/cachexia (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Bruera <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib38">Loprinzi <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The ratios of <italic>n</italic>-6/<italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids may also be a useful criterion for stratification for future trials of fish oil supplementation. Our data suggests chemotherapy as one possible cause for altered fatty acid composition, especially depletion of PUFA. Although preliminary, the most striking feature of the fatty acid profiles of the chemotherapy patients was the very low levels of long chain PUFA (both <italic>n</italic>-6 and <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids) in plasma and cell PL. The <italic>n</italic>-6/<italic>n</italic>-3 ratios were considerably skewed by chemotherapy treatments, with the polyunsaturated <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids being most strongly affected. These changes were observed after induction chemotherapy and exhibited further declines after a high dose chemotherapy regimen, both of which employed widely used agents. Cytotoxic agents have been reported to interfere with the metabolism of PUFA (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib39">Marra <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>) and may limit the endogenous production of EPA and DHA from 18&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;3 <italic>n</italic>-3 and of 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 from 18&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;2 <italic>n</italic>-6. This may support an argument to attempt to increase PUFA levels prior to chemotherapy or to include supplementation with post-chemotherapy re-alimentation.</p><p>We selected 14 days of supplementation, as this length of time was thought to support a high compliance and low drop out rate in a relatively fragile patient group. The efficacy of fatty acid incorporation during our short- term fish oil supplementation may be compared with related studies. Other authors employing fish oil capsules (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Barber <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Gogos <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) or fish oil &#x02013; enriched enteral formula (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Barber, 2001</xref>) to deliver similar amounts of fish oil to those reported here, report comparable elevations of per cent <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in plasma PL of advanced cancer patients using longer intervention periods (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib63">Wigmore <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Barber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). In the present study, the ratio of 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;3 <italic>n</italic>-9 to 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 in plasma PL was reduced following the fish oil treatment and may suggest an improvement in essential fatty acid status. All patients allocated to receive fish oil exhibited increased levels of EPA and DHA in plasma PL, however, we observed poor correspondence between the intake of capsules reported by our patients and the magnitude of alterations in EPA and DHA in their plasma PL. It is unlikely that this discrepancy can be explained entirely by inaccurate reporting of capsules ingested. It is more likely that heterogeneity exists amongst patients in fatty acid digestion, absorption and incorporation into plasma PL. Given the heterogeneity of the individual patient response of plasma PL EPA, it is perhaps not surprising that the main study (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Bruera <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) did not detect a significant treatment effect on weight or body composition. However, in this smaller subgroup of patients, the magnitude of the change in plasma PL EPA, was significantly related to the amount of weight gained by the subjects receiving fish oil, providing evidence for a dose response relationship. These results underline the importance of plasma PL fatty acid levels as a primary measure in oil supplementation studies.</p><p>Feeding fish oil to cancer patients for a short period can alter the fatty acid composition of peripheral immune cells. Supplementation did not raise <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid levels, however we did observe significant reductions in 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6 in the PI fraction of neutrophils. PI is linked to a major receptor binding site (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib31">Hundt and Schmidt, 1992</xref>) important in intracellular signalling and activation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib59">Tissot <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). Increasing the <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acid composition of PI has been reported to be one mechanism for attenuation of pro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib54">Sperling <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). Elevations in <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids accompanied by reductions in 20&#x0200a;:&#x0200a;4 <italic>n</italic>-6, in the PC and PE fractions of neutrophils has been reported after 3 weeks of fish oil supplementation in healthy volunteers consuming larger daily doses of fish oil (9.4&#x02009;g EPA and 5&#x02009;g DHA; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib54">Sperling <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). It is unclear why we did not see any increase in EPA or DHA in neutrophil PL, in spite of significantly increased levels of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in plasma, as changes have been observed within 14 days in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib36">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib60">Tiwary <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Chapkin and Carmichael, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib54">Sperling <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). The low concentrations of plasma PL may have limited the availability and subsequent incorporation of these fatty acids into cell membranes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Chapkin <italic>et al</italic>, 1988</xref>) or supplemented fatty acids may have been directed to oxidative pathways (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib34">Korber <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib67">Zuijdgeest-van Leeuwan <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) rather than incorporated into cellular membranes.

Therefore, obstacles exist that must be addressed in future trials aiming to alter immune functions through lipid supplementation.</p><p>At whatever time fatty acid supplementation may be contemplated, there are important issues pertaining to dose and delivery. Provision of high doses of fish oil and purified EPA may be limited by untoward gastrointestinal side effects, which, in some cases, may be managed by dose reduction or pancreatic enzyme supplements (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Barber, 2001</xref>). Other limiting factors may include pancreatic secretions, absorption of fatty acids, biosynthesis of chylomicron lipid and apoproteins in enterocytes, hepatic uptake of chylomicron remnants and formation of lipid and apoproteins of VLDL, lipoprotein metabolism in blood and transfer of lipid constituents to cells. It would seem critical to determine what impediment(s) exist to propose timely and effective nutritional supplementation. Assessment of fatty acid status and lipid metabolism from the time of diagnosis and throughout the progression of different tumour types and characteristic therapies will provide valuable information regarding the timing of supplementation. Further studies investigating the metabolism of <italic>n</italic>-3 fatty acids in advanced cancer patients are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the excellent assistance of Kathryn Calder and Nicola Wilson.
