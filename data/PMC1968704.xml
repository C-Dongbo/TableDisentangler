Thirty-four patients were treated with cisplatin at 100 mg m-2, followed by 5-fluorouracil at 1,000 mg m-2 by continuous infusion for 5 days. Interferon alpha 2b was administered at the dose of 3 million U i.m. daily for 7 days, beginning the day before chemotherapy. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks. Two patients achieved a complete remission, six a partial response, 14 had stable disease and 12 progressed on therapy, for an overall response rate of 23% (95% confidence interval 10-36%). Median survival time was 5 months. Toxicity was severe. Stomatitis, diarrhoea and myelosuppression were the most common side-effects. Because of the poor response rate and the presence of severe toxicity, in our opinion further clinical trials in head and neck cancer should be attempted only after a better definition in preclinical studies of interactions among 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin and interferon.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00192-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="392" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00192-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="393" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
