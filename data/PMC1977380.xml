The hyperbilirubinaemic patients experienced marked myelosuppression, but only minor symptomatic side-effects. The degree of neutropenia was directly related to the serum bilirubin concentration, but not to any other standard liver test, presence or absence of cirrhosis, or any pharmacokinetic parameter studied including the area under the Adriamycin or adriamycinol concentration-time curve to 48 h or infinity, or the terminal half-life of Adriamycin. The area under the log concentration-time curve was significantly greater for both Adriamycin and adriamycinol in patients who were hyperbilirubinaemic compared to those with normal bilirubin. Whilst hyperbilirubinaemic patients may tolerate a full dose of Adriamycin, we found no evidence that this was associated with a better response rate, which was disappointingly low at only 18%.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0121.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="751" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0122.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="752" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0123.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="753" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0124.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="754" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00069-0125.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="755" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
