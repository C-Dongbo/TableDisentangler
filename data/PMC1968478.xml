The aim of the present prospective study was to identify any relationship between pre-treatment serum CA 242 level and different features of lung cancer including prognosis. Serum CA 242 was measured using the delayed europium lanthanide fluoroimmunometric assay. Sensitivity and specificity were 28.5% and 95.6% respectively. Its level was significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma in comparison with non-squamous histologies (adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma). The CA 242 level was higher in metastatic disease (median: 15.3 U ml-1) in comparison with non-metastatic (median: 7.9 U ml-1; Mann Whitney U test; P &#x0003c; 0.003), and increased significantly from stage I to stage IV. In 50 patients who underwent chemotherapy, the serum CA 242 level was higher in non-responder patients when compared with responders (median: 16.8 U ml-1 and 9.5 U ml-1 respectively; Mann Whitney; P &#x0003c; 0.02). Univariate analysis of the entire population showed serum CA 242 levels were not related to survival. However, patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer and elevated CA 242 level proved to have a significantly shorter survival than those with a CA 242 &#x0003c; 20 U ml-1. In Cox's model analysis, stage of the disease and performance status were the only significant determinants of survival. We conclude that a high level of serum CA 242 (1) is significantly related to the stage of disease, (2) predictive of no response to chemotherapy but seems to add weak prognostic information to stage of disease and performance status, the main prognostic determinants of non-small cell lung cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1423" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0264.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1424" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0265.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1425" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0266.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1426" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0267.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1427" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0268.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1428" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1429" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
