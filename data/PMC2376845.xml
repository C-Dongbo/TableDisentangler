Although both drugs have been used regularly, each drug has been individually evaluated, and as a final result, each patient has normally used either morphine or oxycodone alone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Mucci-LoRusso <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Heiskanen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Klepstad <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Among the strategies for the treatment of cancer pain, there is interest in the coadministration of opioids that act on different receptors (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Heiskanen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Ripamonti and Dickerson, 2001</xref>).

The concept of visual analogue scale (VAS), which consisted of a 10&#x02009;cm line with 0 equalling &#x02018;no pain at all&#x02019; or &#x02018;no nausea&#x02019;, and 10 equalling &#x02018;the worst possible pain&#x02019; or &#x02018;worst possible nausea&#x02019; was introduced previously. Before enrolling in this actual study, patients received 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> tramadol, plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; however, they still complained of pain VAS &#x02a7e;4&#x02009;cm. As part of the protocol, all patients were taking oral 25&#x02009;mg amitriptyline at bedtime.</p><p>The study was started with an open-label, randomised titration phase to achieve stable pain control for 7 days. At this initial phase, patients used only IRM and had free access to it in order to keep pain VAS &#x0003c;4&#x02009;cm. After stable pain relief was achieved, this was followed by a double-blind, crossover phase in two periods, 14 days each. Each patient acts as his&#x0002f;her own control to minimise the interindividual variability of response in this group of patients, and no period of washout was allowed for ethical reasons. At this phase, patients did not know which treatment they were enrolled in. The optimum opioid dosage was calculated on a daily basis, and the consumption ratio of oxycodone to morphine was set at 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1.8, as part of the study protocol. In the literature, this ratio has varied from 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1; 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2; 2&#x02009;:&#x02009;3; 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;4 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Zhukovsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Hanks <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Immediate-release morphine was used as an escape analgesic during the second phase (double blind) of the study in order to get the information related to the morphine&#x0002f;oxycodone interaction.</p><p>Patients were randomised to receive either CRO (14 days) followed by CRM (14 days) (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13), or the same drugs in inverse order (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;13), and were followed on a weekly basis. The doses of either CRM or CRO were assigned daily by the pharmaceutical, who was aware of the drugs and treatment, and set at 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1.8 by the same pharmaceutical (one of the authors). The tablets of IRM were substituted by the respective controlled-release formulation, always by this same investigator. The anaesthesiologists who collected the data weekly were blind to the treatments during the crossover phase. At any point, patients were allowed to use oral IRM (10&#x02009;mg tablets) as an escape analgesic, as needed, in order to keep the numeric value of the pain VAS &#x02a7d;4&#x02009;cm. Patients were asked to assess pain intensity, patient satisfaction, adverse effects and number of rescue morphine tablets, and a different investigator unaware of the treatments, recorded the data weekly. All patients were cooperative and understood the protocol.</p><p>The final collected data were evaluated for each period (14 days) for each patient, related to the consumption of IRM, and to the final ratio of the weekly CRO&#x0002f;CRM, in order to check the initial assumption of the relation of morphine&#x0002f;oxycodone to be 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1.8, made always by the pharmaceutical not involved in data collection. At the end of the study, every patient had received (1) CRM and IRM (the morphine-alone phase), and (2) CRO and IRM (the combined phase). The phase entitled &#x02018;morphine alone&#x02019; received only morphine as analgesic during the 14-day period. The phase entitled &#x02018;combined&#x02019; received both oxycodone and morphine during the 14-day period.

There were no reports of hallucinations or dyspnoea in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of the study have demonstrated that patients suffering from cancer pain receiving the combination of morphine and oxycodone consumed significantly less escape doses of IRM, which was 38&#x00025; higher in patients receiving morphine only. The data suggest that the combination of morphine&#x0002f;oxycodone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Ross and Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) can be a useful alternative to morphine alone, resulting in a better analgesia profile, which is in accordance with animal studies. Coadministration of subantinociceptive doses of oxycodone with morphine to rats by both intracerebroventricular and systemic routes (intraperitoneal and subcutaneous) resulted in synergistic levels of antinociception (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Ross <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Behaviourally, rats coadministered subantinociceptive doses of oxycodone and morphine were not different from control rats related to sedation, while showing antinociception (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Ross <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with the World Health Organisation guidelines for cancer pain relief, when initiating treatment, controlled-release preparations of opioids are generally favoured, and are combined with IRM to prevent or treat breakthrough pain (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Enting <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). In the present study, the optimum opioid dosage was calculated on a daily basis, and the consumption ratio of oxycodone to morphine was set at 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1.8, as part of the study protocol. In the literature, this ratio has varied from 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1, 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;2, 2&#x02009;:&#x02009;3, 3&#x02009;:&#x02009;4 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Zhukovsky <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Hanks <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Washout periods cannot be used for ethical reasons, and a better design including immediate-release oxycodone could not have been carried out due to its unavailability in Brazil. However, the absence of a washout period was overcome by the fact that half of the patients had started the medication with oxycodone, and the other half had started with morphine. Adjuvant therapies that could affect pain control, such as radiation and chemotherapy, were carried out throught the protocol by the patients involved, as detailed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and should not interfere with the final results, as every patient worked as his&#x0002f;her own control.</p><p>As part of the protocol, all patients were exposed to IRM prior to randomisation to CRM or CRO, potentially producing tolerance. Opioids that interact with <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>- and&#x0002f;or <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>-binding sites demonstrate an adaptation process described as desensitisation, due to a reduced interaction with the internal second-messenger system of G-protein (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Freye and Latasch, 2003</xref>). Repeated stimulation of <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>-opioid receptors leads to the heterologous upregulation of <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptor functions in the thalamus and periaqueductal grey regions, which may be associated with the supersensitivity of <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-opioid receptor-mediated antinociception (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Narita <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), and <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>-receptors may be involved in multiple mechanisms in the mesencephalon (Sun and Dalman, 2003). As a consequence, the possibility of tolerance development during the first open phase would rather interfere with patients taking oxycodone, an opioid with a preferential site of action at <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> receptors. In spite of this, the final data revealed that it probably did not occur at the time the study was conducted, based on the lesser IMR consumption in the combined phase.</p><p>Despite the preferential action at <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> receptors (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Ross and Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), oxycodone is an opioid analgesic that closely resembles morphine. Oxymorphine, the active metabolite of oxycodone, is formed in a reaction catalysed by the cytochrome isoenyme CYP2D6, which is under polymorphic, genetic control and severely impaired by liver dysfunction. However, the role of oxymorphone in the analgesic effect of oxycodone is not yet clear (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Heiskanen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Although gender differences exist in response to oxycodone either due to pharmacodynamics or differences in metabolism related to reduced CYP2D6 in females (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Davis <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), in the present study, each patient participated of both study groups, and acts as his&#x0002f;her own control, minimising any analgesic tendency in the female population. In addition, an unidentified metabolite other than oxymorphone appears to be a potent <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> agonist (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Poyhia <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>), and the intrinsic efficacy of oxycodone that may not correlate with binding affinity is not known (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Duttaroy and Yoburn, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Unlike oxycodone, the active metabolite of morphine, morphine-6-glucorinide, appears to have a better toxicity profile and a similar analgesic effect compared to morphine (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Cann <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). While patients received CRM, the consumption of IRM was 38&#x00025; higher compared to the combination group, suggesting a better profile of the association of opioids with preferentially binding sites at <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> and <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> receptors (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), such as morphine and oxycodone.</p><p>Nevertheless, pain relief and side effects such as emesis, sedation, itching and hallucinations have been described following morphine administration, while being less frequent at equianalgesic doses after oxycodone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Mucci-LoRusso <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). In the actual study, when patients received the combination of oxycodone and morphine, they complained of less nausea and vomiting, in accordance with others (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>), while constipation has been reported to be more frequent after oxycodone alone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Heiskanen and Kalso, 1997</xref>). Side effects such as dry mouth, somnolence, constipation, pruritus, sensation of empty head, and good acceptance to the study drugs were not different among patients in the present study (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Nevertheless, group sizes in the range of 30&#x02013;60 would be more appropriate for accuracy of side effects (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the rescue morphine analgesic consumption was 38&#x00025; higher in patients receiving morphine only, compared to patients receiving both morphine and oxycodone, suggesting that the combination of morphine&#x0002f;oxycodone (opioids with differential preferential sites of action) can be a useful alternative to morphine alone, resulting in a better analgesia profile and less emesis. Unfortunately, the cost of CRO treatment in Brazil would be nearly three times more expensive than morphine alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was carried out at the Teaching Hospital of
