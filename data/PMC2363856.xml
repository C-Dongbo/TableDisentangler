The European results are reported here. Patients who had failed first line therapy with a platinum-based regimen received topotecan 0.4&#x02008;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, as a 21-day infusion every 28 days. Patients were only permitted one prior regimen. 35 patients were enrolled and evaluable for response. 3 patients (8.6&#x00025;) had a partial response to treatment (95&#x00025; CI 1.8&#x00025;, 23.1&#x00025;) with a median time to response of 8.1 weeks and a median duration of response of 17.6 weeks. Response was also evaluated by CA125 and was also found to be 8&#x00025;. For all 35 patients, median time to progression was 16.1 weeks and median survival was 43.6 weeks. The principal toxicity was myelosuppression although grade 4 neutropenia occurred in only 8.8&#x00025; of patients (2.1&#x00025; of courses) and infectious complications were relatively infrequent. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild and mainly consisted of gastrointestinal events, alopecia and fatigue. A prolonged infusion of topotecan was well tolerated with a low incidence of severe neutropenia. Responses were seen in both North American and European patients. Response rates varied between the 2 studies possibly due to differences in patient demographics. &#x000a9; 2001 Cancer Research Campaign <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bjcancer.com">http://www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>topotecan</kwd><kwd>continuous intravenous infusion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
