The mechanisms responsible for this synergy remain unclear. In this study, several immune parameters which might be involved in mediating antitumour activity have been monitored serially in 15 patients with advanced malignant melanoma or renal cell cancer during treatment with concurrent IL-2 and alpha-IFN. Both drugs were given subcutaneously in low to moderate (outpatient) dosages but for a prolonged duration. This treatment resulted in remarkable immunomodulation. In vivo induction of cytotoxicity against K562 and Daudi target cells was consistently seen, and percentages of peripheral blood cells expressing CD 25 (IL-2 receptor) and CD 56 (Leu-19) increased. In vitro proliferation of lymphocytes in response to IL-2 was enhanced during the treatment periods, whereas spontaneous proliferation was inhibited. Moreover, correlations between immune parameters and subsequent clinical responses were present in the early phase of the study. Cytotoxicity levels generated in vivo as well as the percentage of CD 56+ lymphocytes were higher in patients who responded to treatment than in non-responders. In contrast, responders had lower levels of CD 25+ cells. These findings indicate that it might be possible to select patients who are likely to benefit from prolonged immunotherapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="163" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="164" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="165" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="166" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="167" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="168" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0179.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="169" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="170" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00203-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="171" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
