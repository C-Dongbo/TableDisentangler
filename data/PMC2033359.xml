A cohort of 149 patients who had undergone 'curative' surgery was followed up according to an intensive protocol in order to detect recurrent disease. Over a median tumour marker follow-up period of 24 months there were 25 recurrences in 24 patients. Both CEA and CA-242 alone detected half the local recurrences. The sensitivity of CEA was 84% for distant or mixed recurrence compared with 64% for CA-242. An abnormality of either CEA or CA-242 enabled detection of five out of six local recurrences and 17 out of 19 distant or mixed recurrences with a median lead time of 5 months for each marker. Both markers were elevated concurrently in only one local and 11 distant recurrences. While CA-242 alone is not superior to CEA, their combined use (either abnormal) has a high sensitivity (88%), specificity (78%) and negative predictive value (97%); this may be useful in reducing unnecessary investigations in follow-up programmes and as a guide to the initiation of further treatment for recurrent disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="549" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="550" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="551" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="552" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00055-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="553" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
