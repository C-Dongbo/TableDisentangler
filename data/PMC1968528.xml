There was a significant association between the HPA staining and AX or IM metastases. When HPA staining was regarded as an indicator of AX metastases, a diagnostic accuracy of 72%, a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 75% were achieved. As an indicator of IM metastases, these values were 64%, 76% and 62%, respectively. In predicting the presence of AX metastases using a discriminant function with clinical AX status, location of tumour and tumour size, diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 79%, 69% and 87%, respectively. In predicting the presence of IM metastases using the discriminant function with clinical AX status and tumour size, these values were 74%, 71% and 75%, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the HPA staining may be useful, but it was equivalent with the discriminant function with clinical variables in prediction of AX or IM metastases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1368" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1369" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1370" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00208-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1371" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
