Count rates from suspect tumour lesions and adjacent normal tissue were expressed as a ratio before (Rin situ) and after (Rex vivo) excision. 111In activity concentration ratios of tumour tissue to blood (T/B) were determined in a gamma counter. In patients with midgut carcinoids, (all scintigraphy positive), false Rin situ recordings were found in 4/29 macroscopically identified tumours. T/B ratios were all high (27-650). In patients with medullary thyroid carcinomas (eight out of ten scintigraphy positive), misleading Rin situ results were found in 4/37 macroscopically identified tumours. T/B ratios were lower (3-39) than those seen in midgut carcinoids. Two out of four patients with endocrine pancreatic tumours had positive scintigraphy, reliable intraoperative measurements and very high T/B ratios (910-1500). One patient with a gastric carcinoid had correct measurements in situ and ex vivo with high T/B ratios (71-210). In situ measurements added little information to preoperative scintigraphy and surgical findings using the present detection system. Rex vivo measurements were more reliable. The very high T/B ratios seen in midgut carcinoids and some endocrine pancreatic tumours would be favourable for future radiation therapy via somatostatin receptors.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0062-a" xlink:role="772"/></fig><fig id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0063-a" xlink:role="773"/></fig><fig id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0064-a" xlink:role="774"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="770" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="771" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="772" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="773" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="774" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00034-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="775" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
